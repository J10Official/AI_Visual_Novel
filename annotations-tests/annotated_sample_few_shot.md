Here is the rewritten text with the same process applied:

**Scene 1: Introduction**

FADE IN:
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
A dull highway. A crappy sedan roars by.
INT. CRAPPY CAR - DAY
MIKE ENSLIN, 35, a grizzled, weary soul, stares at the road ahead.
He takes a drag on his cigarette and exhales slowly.

**Scene 2: The Country Road**

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
Mike stands outside his car, soaked from driving through the rain.
He checks a wet map on the dashboard.
EXT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT
MIKE enters the inn, greeted by the friendly INNKEEPERS.
MR. INNKEEPER and MRS. INNKEEPER jump up to welcome Mike.
They offer him a room and check-in process.

**Scene 3: The Inn**

INT. INN ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Mike lies on his bed, exhausted from driving through the night.
The sounds of thunder outside create an eerie atmosphere.
Suddenly, a loud crash echoes through the room.
MIKE jolts awake, startled, and then realizes it's just thunder.

**Scene 4: The Car Ride**

EXT. CRAPPY CAR - DRIVING - DAY
Mike drives another endless interstate.
He speaks flatly into a pocket MINI-RECORDER:
MIKE (TO HIMSELF)
People spoke of the spectral presence of Sylvia... though I personally never encountered her.

**Scene 5: Barnes & Noble**

INT. BARNES & NOBLE - NIGHT
MIKE enters, disheveled, and approaches the cash register.
The CASHIER looks up from his task.

MIKE: I'm Mike Enslin.
CASHIER: (dawning awareness)
Oh, right! Okay then!

**Scene 6: The Book Signing**

INT. BARNES & NOBLE - LATER
The cash register is open, and the CASHIER holds up a flyer:
ASSISTANT MANAGER:
Attention, book lovers!
In the Author's Corner tonight, we have Mike Enslin!

MIKE leans into the CASHIER.
MIKE: You got a bathroom I can clean up in? First?
CUT TO:

**Scene 7: The Bookstore**

INT. BARNES & NOBLE - LATER
The bookshelf is sad and generic, with a listless atmosphere.

MIKE enters the store and approaches the cash register.
MID-BOOKSTORE WORKER:
Excuse me... I'm Mike Enslin.
CASHIER (CONT'D):
(skeptical)
Oh? The "star" of your booksigning tonight?

**Scene 8: Debunking**

INT. BARNES & NOBLE - LATER
The crowd starts to gather, and the EMPHATIC MAN raises his hand.

EMPHATIC MAN:
6.
Have you ever seen a poltergeist?
MIKE (TO HIMSELF)
See? That's exactly what I'm talking about. You didn't hear one word I just said. I can type myself sick debunking these places...

The crowd looks at each other in confusion, and the EMPHATIC MAN continues to speak.

**Scene 9: The Conclusion**

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
A dull highway. A crappy sedan roars by.
MIKE drives back to his car, tired but still skeptical of the haunted inn.

FADE OUT.

Here are the suggestions to make the text more effective:

1. **Improve formatting**: The text is written in a fragmented and unstructured manner, making it hard to follow. Consider breaking up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs or using headings to separate sections.
2. **Vary sentence structure**: Many sentences follow a similar pattern (e.g., "MIKE lies on his back..."), which makes the text feel repetitive. Varying sentence structures can create more interest and engage the reader.
3. **Use active voice**: The majority of the text is written in passive voice, which can make it seem less engaging. Try rewriting sentences in active voice to improve clarity and control.
4. **Show, don't tell**: Instead of stating that Mike is "bored out of his mind," show this through his actions, thoughts, or expressions. This will help the reader understand his emotions and state of mind better.
5. **Use descriptive language**: The text could benefit from more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind. Use metaphors, similes, and other literary devices to create more sensory experiences.
6. **Clarify transitions**: The text jumps abruptly between scenes, making it difficult to follow. Consider using transitional phrases or words to connect ideas and paragraphs.
7. **Use headings and subheadings**: Break up the long block of text into sections using headings and subheadings to make it easier for the reader to navigate and understand the structure of the story.
8. **Add more sensory details**: The text could benefit from more sensory details, such as what Mike sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels during his experiences. This will help create a richer and more immersive reading experience.

Some specific suggestions based on your request:

* For the first scene, consider starting with a clearer introduction to Mike's character and setting.
* In the second scene, try to show instead of tell that Mike is "bored out of his mind."
* When describing Mike's emotions during the surf session, use more descriptive language to convey his state of mind (e.g., feeling calm, exhilarated, or overwhelmed).
* Consider adding more sensory details to describe what Mike sees and experiences in different locations.
* In the final scene, try to create a clearer sense of tension or conflict before it resolves.

Here's an example of how you could apply these suggestions:

**Scene 1:**

INT. MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mike lies on his back, staring at the ceiling as he tries to read his book. The dim lighting casts eerie shadows on the walls, and the clock ticks away with a soothing melody.

As he reads, Mike's thoughts wander to his upcoming trip to New England. He imagines the scenic views, historic mansions, and picturesque towns that await him.

Suddenly, his eyes fall upon a dusty old book on the bedside table. The cover is worn and faded, but the words "The Road Back Nowhere" are emblazoned in bold letters. Mike's curiosity is piqued, and he can't help but wonder what secrets this book holds.

**Scene 2:**

INT. MIKE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Mike sits in a corner booth, staring at his laptop screen with a mixture of annoyance and boredom. The fluorescent lights overhead seem to hum in sync with the ticking clock on his wrist. He longs for something more exciting than running errands.

As he browses through online ads, Mike's eyes land on a mysterious hotel website: "1408 - Don't Enter." His curiosity piqued, he clicks on the link and begins to explore the site.

**Scene 3:**

INT. MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mike sits on his couch, staring at a stack of papers and mail that seem to be multiplying before his eyes. He's bored out of his mind, and the weight of the pile is starting to feel oppressive.

Suddenly, his gaze falls upon a laptop on the coffee table. The screen glows with a faint blue light as he types away in the browser. A new tab opens, and Mike finds himself on an unfamiliar website: "No Signal Available."

**Scene 4:**

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Mike exits the building, feeling restless and frustrated. He approaches a man sitting at a table outside, typing away on his laptop. The man looks up, catches Mike's eye, and offers him a smile.

MIKE:
(awkwardly)
Uh... hi there.

MAN:
(laughing)
Just trying to stay connected in these strange times!

Mike is taken aback by the man's words, but he tries to play it cool. As they chat, Mike finds himself opening up to this stranger about his feelings and frustrations.

**Scene 5:**

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

As Mike leaves the coffee shop, he feels a sense of resolve wash over him. He realizes that sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of courage to face our fears and take action.

Mike picks up speed as he navigates through the crowded streets, his heart pounding in his chest. Suddenly, he spots a signal on the horizon - a glimmer of hope in the darkness.

As he approaches the signal, Mike feels a rush of adrenaline course through his veins. He's ready to face whatever lies ahead, armed with nothing but his determination and a hint of curiosity.

Here's a step-by-step guide to applying the same process:

**Extract the main plot**

1. Start with the first line: "l and starts EXPERTLY / TYPING."
2. Identify the key events that unfold from this line.
3. Move on to the next lines, which form the narrative flow.

**Create a detailed outline**

1. Divide the story into manageable chunks based on the dialogue and actions.
2. Label each chunk with a descriptive title (e.g., "Mike goes to Google" or "Dolphin Hotel discovery").
3. Organize the content within each chunk in chronological order.

**Develop the plot structure**

1. Identify the main conflicts, obstacles, and turning points in the story.
2. Connect these elements through cause-and-effect relationships, logical progression, and emotional resonance.
3. Ensure that the plot is coherent, engaging, and well-paced.

**Improve character development**

1. Describe the characters' motivations, goals, and emotions throughout the story.
2. Show how their actions impact the world around them (e.g., Mike's decision to visit the Dolphin Hotel).
3. Highlight any conflicts or tensions that arise between characters.

**Enhance descriptive language**

1. Use vivid, sensory details to bring the setting, characters, and events to life.
2. Employ metaphors, similes, and other literary devices to create rich, immersive descriptions.
3. Ensure that language is concise, clear, and accessible.

**Add depth and complexity**

1. Introduce new plot twists or subplots to add layers of interest and surprise.
2. Explore themes, emotions, and ideas that resonate with the story's core message.
3. Consider how characters' actions can have unintended consequences, raising questions about morality, free will, etc.

**Refine the writing style**

1. Edit for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors to ensure clarity and professionalism.
2. Use active voice instead of passive voice where possible.
3. Vary sentence structure to create a dynamic rhythm.
4. Ensure that sentences are concise and focused on one main idea.

Here's an example of how this might be applied to the text:

**Extracted key events**

1. Mike types in "Dolphin Hotel New York" to search for information.
2. The computer responds with links to various articles, including "Suicide" and "Drowning."
3. Mike clicks on a link to a Dolphin hotel webpage, which leads him to the Dolphins' physical address.

**Detailed outline**

 Chunk 1: Mike searches online

* He types in "Dolphin Hotel New York"
* The computer responds with links to various articles
* Mike clicks on a link to the Dolphin hotel's website
* He reads about the hotel's history and reputation

Chunk 2: Discovery of the Dolphin Hotel

* Mike learns that he can find Room 1408, but it needs to be booked through Clay.
* He receives an update from Sam, his lawyer friend, who confirms the booking details.

**Developed plot structure**

Conflict 1: Claws for Alarm
Mike discovers a Federal Civil Rights law and decides to book a room at the Dolphin Hotel.

Turning point: Mike's encounter with Sam reveals that the hotel is not exactly what it seems.

**Improved character development**

Motivation: Mike wants to use the Dolphin Hotel as inspiration for his next novel.
Goal: Book Room 1408 and uncover the secrets of the hotel.
Emotions: Fear, uncertainty, excitement

**Enhanced descriptive language**

"New York's towering skyscrapers pierce the sky like shards of glass."

"Mike's eyes scanned the sleek, modern lobby, where designer furniture seemed to hum with electricity."

"Every step revealed a new surprise: a stunning city view, a vintage car parked outside, or a quirky street performer entertaining the crowds."

**Added depth and complexity**

New plot twist: Mike discovers that Room 1408 is actually haunted by the ghost of a former hotel owner.
Subplot: Sam's true intentions for booking the room are revealed to be more sinister than initially thought.

**Refined writing style**

* I used active voice instead of passive voice in several places.
* I varied sentence structure to create a dynamic rhythm, with short and long sentences that emphasize different ideas.
* I ensured that language was concise and clear, with no unnecessary words or phrases.

**The View Spins**

Mike recoils, nauseated, and slumps against a wall.

EXT. DOLPHIN HOTEL - NIGHT

25
A sumptuous refuge from the Jazz Age, the DOLOPHIN HOTEL dominates the portal. It leaps like a dolphin into the night air.
MIKE
I need some rest.
INT. OLIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
27
27
An impeccable Edwardian study. Oak paneling. Fine books. An antique desk with a lozenge-shaped green lamp.
OLIN
(whispering) You're not going back to 1408, Mr. Enslin.
MIKE
What are you talking about? I need my room.
OLIN
You don't belong there, sir. The guests who died, they all came from this hotel.

**The Path Becomes Deeper**

Olin's eyes narrow as he listens to Mike's response.
OLIN
I've seen the damage it causes. The ghosts that haunt 1408 are not of this world.
MIKE
What do you mean? It's just a building.
OLIN
(leaning in) You're playing with forces beyond your control, Mr. Enslin.

**The Darkness Grows**

Mike takes Olin's words to heart and realizes he needs his room.
MIKE
I need my room. Please give it back to me.
Olin glares at Mike before nodding curtly and returning the key.
OLIN
You can have your room, Mr. Enslin. But be warned: once you enter 1408, there's no turning back.

**The Clock Strikes Midnight**

Mike heads out of Olin's office, his heart racing with anticipation.
INT. OLIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
27
27
As the clock strikes midnight, Mike exits Olin's office, a sense of foreboding growing in his chest.

MIKE
(whispering) I don't want to go back. I don't want to...

**The Darkness Consumes Him**

As the night wears on, Mike becomes increasingly unhinged, his mind shattered by the horrors he experiences in room 1408.
INT. OLIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
27
27
Olin's face is etched with worry as he listens to Mike's pleas for mercy.

OLIN
I'll never give you a chance, Mr. Enslin. You're not welcome here...

**The Final Descent**

Mike's eyes go black, and his body collapses to the floor, a victim of the hotel's dark forces.
INT. OLIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
27
27
Olin stands alone in the room, his heart heavy with regret.

OLIN
(whispering) I should have warned you...

**The Lesson Learned**

As Olin turns to leave, he sees a figure lurking in the shadows, watching him.
OLIN
A figure? What are you doing here?

The figure steps forward, revealing none other than Randolph Hyde, the orthodontist who died at room 1408.

HYDE
I've been waiting for this moment. The hotel's secrets will finally be revealed...

**The Dark Legacy**

As Olin turns to flee, he realizes that the hotel has a dark legacy, one that threatens to consume him and everyone around him.
OLIN
The guests who died were not just ordinary people... they were all connected in ways you can't imagine.

**The Final Curtain Call**

Olin's eyes widen as he understands the true horror of the hotel's past.
OLIN
You're playing with forces beyond your control...

MIKE
(whispering) I'm not alone...

Here's my attempt to break down the text and identify key elements:

**Story Premise**

The story appears to be about a protagonist named Michael Enslin, who has gone missing while working at the Dolphin Hotel. He leaves behind a series of cryptic notes and recordings that seem to hint at his true identity and disappearance.

**Plot Points**

1. Michael's supervisor, Olin, is revealed to have been working in Room 1408 for some time, and he seems to be obsessed with Michael.
2. A series of strange events occur, including the discovery of a young mother locked in the bathroom, and a mysterious room number (1408) that seems to appear throughout the hotel.
3. Michael becomes increasingly agitated as he explores Room 1408, which appears to be some kind of bizarre torture chamber or research facility.
4. He eventually discovers that the room is actually an "evil" place, where humans are subjected to various forms of abuse and experimentation.

**Themes**

* The theme of the hotel seems to be exploring themes of trauma, psychological manipulation, and the blurring of reality and fantasy.
* The use of cryptic notes and recordings suggests a sense of paranoia and mistrust among the characters.

**Character Analysis**

1. Olin is portrayed as a cold and calculating individual who seems to be driven by a desire for power or control over Michael.
2. Michael's emotional state is largely unstable, with moments of anger, fear, and despair.
3. The Young Mother in Room 1408 appears to be a symbol of hope and redemption, but her presence also serves as a reminder of the hotel's true nature.

**Symbolism**

* Room 1408 seems to represent a place of confinement, torture, or experimentation (e.g., the water stain).
* The hotel itself could be seen as a symbol of the psychological manipulation of its guests, with Olin serving as a mastermind controlling the hotel's "experimented" inhabitants.
* The use of dark colors and stark lighting in Room 1408 creates an atmosphere of foreboding and unease.

**Style**

The text is written in a lyrical and introspective style, with moments of sharp dialogue and humor. The author seems to be playing with the reader's perceptions, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.

Overall, this text appears to be a complex and thought-provoking exploration of psychological themes, trauma, and the darker aspects of human nature.

Here's the breakdown of the text into smaller parts and applying the same process:

**Part 1: Introduction to Room 1408**

* We MOVE TO the THERMOSTAT, where MIKE is trying to fix it.
* The room has a queen-size bed, two nightstands, and butterfly wallpaper.

**Room 1408's Initial State**

* Mike sees another building outside with cars and a bank clock in the window.
* Traffic noise rises in.

**Mike's Panic**

* He turns off the radio and tries to turn on the alarm switch.
* The clock's radio suddenly starts singing "We've only just begun."

**Mike's Confusion**

* He looks around, trying to find someone to fix his thermostat. There's no one.
* He notices that the toilet paper roll has returned to its original state.

**Room 1408's Hidden Features**

* Mike discovers a hidden world of ghostly activity in the room:
	+ Mints on the pillows
	+ A miniature bathroom with a toilet and sink
	+ A strange, eerie glow from an UV light

**Mike's Confusion and Exploration**

* He realizes that he can't see anything unusual, but his equipment is still detecting anomalies.
* He turns on the lights to normalcy.

**The Paintings' Disturbance**

* Mike sees that the three paintings are slightly askew.
* The ship's crooked horizon is unpleasantly vivid.
* A strange seal-like sensation overpowers him.

**Mike's Disorientation and Panic**

* He stumbles around, disoriented, with a "woozy" feeling.
* He tries to make sense of what's happening, but his mind is clouded.

**The Door's Distortion**

* Mike sees that the door is distorted through the glass.
* He peeks through the eyehold to find an engineer in overalls.

**Mike's Reaction and Response**

* The engineer introduces himself as someone who can help with a problem with the thermostat.
* Mike gruffly answers, still trying to process what he's seeing.

Here's a breakdown of the text in the same format as before:

1. **Open the door.** He pulls - and it’s 
stuck! It won’t budge.
Mike struggles with the handle.
MIKE
39.
The door’s stuck! Can you give it a shove?
GRUFF VOICE
(beat)
I ain’t touching it.
Mike reacts, irritated. He tugs harder, wrenching with all his might — when, it suddenly releases and SLAMS open. BAM!
Mike tumbles, off-balance.
THE DOOR
opens wide. Revealed is the ENGINEER, a huge, heavyset man.
He carries a steel toolbox.
ENGINEER
Is it too hot or too cold?
MIKE
Oh, it’s definitely too hot. C’mon 
in. The box is right here —
Mike strides over to the thermostat. He starts to gesture to the panel — when he realizes — he's... alone.
Confused, Mike turns.
The guy is still standing in the doorway.
Mike gestures again, for emphasis.
MIKE
I said... the box is here.
ENGINEER
know where the fuck it is. But I 
ain’t going in that room.
What! Mike glowers, put-out.
MIKE
You just have to walk seven or eight feet —
ENGINEER
I said I’m not goin’ in! You know what happened in there?
MIKE
Yes, I'm quite aware -—
40.
ENGINEER
Look, I'll talk you through it. Any 
jackass can fix that thing.
(beat)
Just remove the panel.
The Engineer waits, feet planted.
Mike stares in disbelief. Then, beaten, he pulls off the thermostat PANEL. Inside are springs and levers.
ENGINEER
Okay. Now -- inside, you see a 
coil?
MIKE
Yes.
ENGINEER
Good. Now above that coil is a 
little tube filled with mercury. 
That's supposed to activate the 
contact switch, but this hotel's so 
old, half the shit don't work.
(beat)
Just give the tube a little tap.
Mike glares, unsure.
ENGINEER
Just tap the thing!
MIKE
FLICKS the tube. The mercury suddenly emits 
a blue SPARK, then rolls downward.
The system CHURNS, then the air-conditioning BLOWS on. Mike smiles t relieved.
MIKE
You're a genius. Let me get you a 
tip —
Mike turns to thank the man — and he’s GONE.
Huh? Bewildered, Mike runs to the door. He peers out.
His POV - DOWN THE CORRIDOR
The hall is empty. The elevator doors glide closed.
MIKE
frowns. Odd...
41.
A discombobulated beat, then he pulls his head back in.
Haltingly, he shuts the door.
INT. ROOM
38
38
Mike's alone. He paces about , convincing himself he’s 
okay...
When — sudden jarring MUSIC.
THE CARPENTERS (0.S.)
"We’ve only just begun..."
MIKE whirls! The CLOCK RADIO has turned back on.
THE CARPENTERS (0.S.)
“To live..."
MIKE
Christ, you again?!
AT THE RADIO
Mike marches over. He once again CLICKS OFF the radio.
The digital clock flickers, then switches to "60:00."
Suddenly, it starts counting backward: “59:59... 59:58..."
MIKE gulps in disbelief. In his mind, he remembers Olin's warning from before...
OLIN'S VOICE
"Nobody has ever lasted longer than 
an hour..."
Hm. Mike glances worriedly at the clock ticking down.
Silence.
He realizes something odd. The SILENCE is ABSOLUTE. The traffic noise is gone.
Perplexed, Mike walks to the window. He sticks his head out.
OUTSIDE
42.
It looks exactly as before, The New York street is filled 
with a crush of traffic, buses, people, Except, 
disconcertingly, there is literally no sound,
Mike can't hear anything. It's as if we're watching a TV show 
with the volume turned off.
A fire engine races by, lights flashing. Dead silent.
MIKE
is confounded. The lack of noise is highly disturbing. He 
stares, then pulls his head in...
When CRASH! The WINDOW VIOLENTLY SLAMS DOWN on MIKE'S HAND!
MIKE
AAAGGHHHHH!
Mike SCREAMS, agonized. An animal caught in a trap.
MIKE
GODDAMN!! FUCKI!!!
Mike struggles, fighting to use his good hand to crack the 
window open. Finally he tears his broken hand out.
TIGHT - HAND
It's a mess. The skin is ripped, bleeding.
Panicked, Mike runs into
INT. BATHROOM
39
39
He turns on the sink. Water streams out, as he puts his 
wounded hand under the flow.
But then — the faucet SPUTTERS and dies.
Mike angrily turns the handles. Nothing. Livid, he punches 
the sink.
MIKE
You son-of-a...
FWOOOOOOSH! Suddenly SCALDING HOT WATER spews out!
Yeow!!!! It BURNS Mike’s hand.
Mike CRIES OUT. He yanks away his hand, now bloody AND burnt.
The radio goes off.
43.
THE CARPENTERS
"We‘ve only just begun..."
Mike SHRIEKS.
MIKE
Fuck YOU, radio!!
INT. BEDROOM
40
40
Incensed, Mike lunges in, grabs the electrical cord, and 
PULLS it from the wall!
And — nothing changes. The song keeps playing. The timer 
keeps clicking down: ”56:24... 56:23..."
Mike gasps in disbelief. Flummoxed, he staggers back to
INT. BATHROOM
41
41
He grabs a towel and wraps it around his bleeding hand.
INT. BEDROOM
42
42
A gust of wind blows in, ruffling the curtains. We follow 
the breeze across the room... to the BIBLE on the nightstand.
The wind flutters the pages. They flip by... then stop.
CLOSEUP - BIBLE
The page is covered with SCRAWLED, MANIC WORDS:
"DON'T LET ME DIE HERE"
WIDE
Suddenly, RINGGGGG!!!
Mike jumps. Surprised, he runs to the phone. He grabs it.
MIKE
YES??!!
HOTEL VOICE
Sir, I'm sorry, but there was a 
miscommunication in the kitchen. 
There’s going to be a ten-minute 
delay on your sandwich.
MIKE's eyes bug out.
44.
MIKE
What sandwich?! I didn't order a 
sandwich!!
MIKE
(crazed)
But as long as we're on the phone 
let's talk about the window that 
just broke my hand, and the water 
that burned me alive!!
A long pause. Then —
HOTEL VOICE
I'm sorry. You're welcome to 
substitute a side dish for your 
french fries. We have cottage 
cheese, macaroni salad —
MIKE
Are you croddam LISTENING to me?! 
My hand needs STITCHES —
HOTEL VOICE
I understand. If you leave your dry 
cleaning out by 10 a.m., we'll have 
it pressed and returned by 5 the 
same day.
Mike gapes.
MIKE
FUCK! Fuck YOU! I want you to call 
me a cab to the nearest hospital!
The Hotel Voice turns sour, ruffled.
HOTEL VOICE
Sir, I will not tolerate you 
speaking to me in that tone of 
voice —
MIKE
You’re a fuckin’ IDIOT!
HOTEL VOICE
If you wish, I can connect you to 
our manager, Mr. Olin.
MIKE
GOOD! Olin it is! Put him on!!
Pause —- then the line goes on HOLD. Sprightly MUSIC kicks back in.

Here is the rewritten text with the same process applied:

icks 
in. The RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT we heard before repeats:
The room falls silent.
SMOOTH RECORDING
"Welcome to Dolphin Hotel. Enjoy our finest dining at the Blue Marlin Restaurant on the Mezzanine level."
Mike waits, stewing.
He watches his blood dripping out of his hand. The red 
droplets hitting the carpet...
SMOOTH RECORDING
"Muscles tense? Then make an appointment to visit our deluxe spa, on the Coral level. With full massage, facial, and aromatherapy facilities, it'll leave you feeling relaxed and revitalized."
Mike’s hand keeps bleeding.
His temper is growing.
SMOOTH RECORDING
"Your call is important to us. Please stay on the line—"
CLICK — BEEEEEEEP!
It’s a DIALTONE.
Mike has been disconnected.
He stares in amazement.
MIKE
You are kidding.
Furious, Mike throws the phone.
He grips his wounded hand and stomps into the
INT. LIVING ROOM
43
43
Mike's fed up. He rushes to the door, going to open it -—
And... the deadbolt's locked.
Huh? Uncertain, Mike fumbles in his pocket for the big ROOM 
KEY. He angrily jams it into the lock, thrusting it through 
the oversize hole.
46.
And — PLIP! The key slips from Mike’s fingers — plunging into 
the door! It disappears, gone.
MIKE
Wha—?!
Mike fiddles with the keyhole, trying to find the key.
Frustrated, he slams his EYE up against the hole.
HIS POV
Blackness. Hollow. A gentle whisper inside...
MIKe'S EYEBALL
bulges, peering up... down...
WIDE - MIKE
He scowls. He spins and looks around... thinking. Mike runs 
to his bag, unzips a pocket, and pulls out his LETTER OPENER.
Mika jams the metal blade into the keyhole. He wiggles it... 
trying... desperately... to engage the mechanics...
MIKE
C’mon...
He struggles to nick the lock. Forcing it around... when — 
CLUNK! The DEADBOLT UNLOCKS!
MIKE
Yeah!
Mike smiles victoriously. He triumphantly turns the handle --
AND —
CRACK! The DOOR HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND.
CLOSEUP - MIKE
His face goes ashen. This is unconceivable.
The door is now unopenable from the inside.
WIDE
Mike goes rabid, furiously KICKING the door! He PUNCHES it 
with his bruised hand. He claws crazily at the handle stump.
He's TRAPPED.
47.
Losing it, Mike whirls and careens across the room. Passing
THE THERMOSTAT
which now reads 75 degrees. 74...
AT THE WINDOW
Mike runs to the pane and throws it open. He SCREAMS.
MIKE
HELLO?!!
OUTSIDE
It's utterly silent, like before. Not a sound from the busy 
traffic.
Mike screams louder.
MIKE
Up here! HELP!!!
Mike’s VOICE ECHOES, the only noise in the world,
ECHO
HELP... HELP... HELP...!
This is very disturbing.
Mike peers around — then spots a lit window across the 
street. There is a SILHOUETTED MAN.
Mike gasps, a ray of hope.
MIKE
Hey! Sir!!
No reaction. He SCREAMS louder.
MIKE
CAN YOU SEE ME?! OVER HERE, IN THE 
DOLPHIN??
Mike waves his right arm.
ACROSS THE STREET
The Man waves his right arm.
MIKE
MIKE
YES, HERE! I NEED YOU TO CALL THE 
POLICE!!
48.
Mike jumps, excited.
ACROSS THE STREET
The Man jumps, too. An exact rhyming movement.
MIKE
suddenly halts, horrified.
THE MAN
freezes.
MIKE
slowly... worriedly... shifts from side to side.
THE MAN
mirror-like, shifts from side to side.
MIKE
trembles. Fearful, shaking, he leans toward the lamp.
THE MAN
leans toward a lamp. Revealing... he... is... Mike.
MIKE
freezes, stunned. He is watching himself.
CLOSER VIEW - THE MAN
is Mike, standing in a parallel version of the hotel room,
h Staring blank-eyed at us.
A chilling beat — and then an INSANE MANIAC with a clawhammer 
comes rushing into view. He swings the hammer straight at the 
doppelganger's head.
ANGLE - MIKE
He SCREAMS and spins in fear.
WIDE
And — the Maniac isn’t there. Mike is alone.
Mike's chest heaves, overcome. Panicked, whirling about. Off-
balance, he spins back to the view outside.
49.
ACROSS THE WAY
The man is gone. The lit window is gone, It's just darkness.
Mike is befuddled.
MIKE
What the f-—?
He stares, shaking and impotent. Then, he notices the PEOPLE 
below on the street. Silent, but — real.
Desperate, Mike suddenly goes deranged.
He picks up a LAMP -
MIKE
HELP ME!!!
WIDE - THE WINDOW
Mike unplugs the lamp and THROWS it! It flies out the window 
and soars outward!
Mike lurches out, to watch what happens--
The LAMP drops. Down... down...
MIKE
waits eagerly, wild-eyed.
THE LAMP
drops closer to the street... then...
Dissipates.
Like mist, it just... disappears. The lamp is gone.
MIKE’S EYES
bug out.
MIKE
Jesus, I'm losing my mind. I'm 
hallucinating.
INT. LIVING ROOM

Unsteady, Mike collapses. He feels helpless, like the walls 
are closing in...
50.
Then — an ethereal LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE.
Wispy, faint...
GIRL’S VOICE
Daddy... Daddy.......
We suddenly PUSH IN TO MIKE. He CLUTCHES for breath.
ALLI color bleeds from his face. He holds his head, gasping.
MIKE
Stop it. Get ahold of yourself. 
You're letting your mind run to 
places that aren’t real.
(he works to calm 
himself)
It’s just a classic haunted house 
power of suggestion: Gaslit 
fixtures. Faded rugs. Like that 
motel in Kansas. There’s a reason 
for everything...
The radio continues its ominous countdown: 46:25.,. 46:24.
Mike peers around, scoping — then sees something. Maddened, 
he hobbles up to the AIRVENT.
ANGLE - VENT
There is... something inside the vent. A tiny black TUBE?
MIKE
Is that a camera? A spycam?
(accusatory)
Hello?! Who are you, the perverted 
owner of the hotel? Some rich 
sadist, enjoying my terror?
(beat)
Or perhaps it's just punctilious 
Mr. Olin, whacking-off in his 
leather chair.
ANGLE - MIKE
He is cracking. Paranoid.
MIKE
Wait a second..! He gave me booze,
(trying to focus)
Was it laced? Did Olin take a 
sip...? Can't remember...
51.
Mike eyes are glazed. He spots the Cognac bottle. He runs 
over and uncorks it, taking a sniff...
Hm. Something else catches his eye.
ON THE NIGHTSTAND
are the mint wrappers. Mike gasps, remorseful.
MIKE
Agh! The mystery chocolate. Shit! 
Never take candy from a stranger.
Mike's mind ratchets into overdrive, freaking. Until —
GIRL'S VOICE
Daddy, pay attention!
MIKE whirls.

Note: I've kept the same structure and formatting as the original text, but with some minor adjustments to accommodate the new content.

I'll break down this complex text into manageable sections.

**Section 1: Establishing the Premise**

The story begins with Mike entering a home video recording of himself as a child playing with his daughter Gracie. The scene shifts to a younger Mike, who is cheerful and carefree, sitting on the floor with Gracie, holding a doll. A younger version of Mike appears in the video, and he becomes sad when seeing his own childhood self.

**Section 2: Introducing Characters and Setting**

The story then introduces Lily, Mike's former wife, and her aloof demeanor. The three share a brief conversation, where Lily feigns shock at Mike's marriage to Gracie. Later, an older man hangs himself from a noose on the chandelier.

**Section 3: Mike's Descent into Madness**

As Mike tries to cope with the events of the previous scene, he becomes increasingly agitated and distraught. He is haunted by images of his childhood self, including the old man in the nursing home bathroom. The "shadow" in Section 2 begins to manifest itself throughout the story.

**Section 4: Exploring Madness**

The narrative shifts into a dream-like state as Mike's perception of reality becomes distorted. He starts to question whether he is dreaming or actually experiencing events. He paces around, thinking about his past and trying to remember when it all started.

**Section 5: The Reality Check**

Mike becomes overwhelmed by the implications of what he has experienced. He wonders if he can truly die in his sleep, as people say, and if he should be afraid of being stuck in a never-ending cycle of dreams.

**Section 6: The Descent into Paranoia**

As Mike's anxiety grows, he becomes increasingly paranoid about his own sanity. He starts to question the "shadow" that haunts him, wondering whether it is truly real or just a product of his imagination.

**Section 7: The Breakdown**

The narrative reaches its climax as Mike tries to escape from reality. He leaps out of the window and into the wind, only to be pulled back inside by some unseen force. As he lies in bed, dazed and disoriented, the reader is left questioning what is real and what is just a dream.

**Section 8: The Endgame**

The story ends with Mike trapped in his own mind, oscillating between reality and dreams. The final shot of the scene shows Mike's POV, looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings as if trying to regain control over his environment.

Throughout this text, you can identify recurring themes such as:

* The blurring of reality and fantasy
* The fragility of human perception and sanity
* The idea that our experiences shape us into who we become

These themes are intertwined throughout the narrative, making for a complex and thought-provoking story.

Here's an analysis of the provided text:

**Story Structure and Pacing**

The story has a non-linear structure, jumping back and forth in time. The narrative jumps from 1968 to 2019, with each chapter representing a different era. This non-linearity creates a sense of disorientation and confusion for the protagonist.

* Chapter 1 (1968) sets up Mike's backstory and introduces the setting.
* Chapter 2-3 (1990s/2000s) introduces the theme of hotel rooms being creepy and the protagonist's obsession with them.
* Chapter 4-5 (2019) jumps forward in time, revealing a more recent event (the woman being eaten by wolves).

The pacing is uneven, with long stretches between chapters. This can create a sense of disorientation and make it difficult for the reader to follow.

**Character Development**

Mike is the main character, and his development throughout the story is quite pronounced. He begins as an arrogant self-hating bastard but gradually becomes more erratic and desperate as the story progresses.

* Mike's inner monologue provides insight into his thoughts and feelings.
* His actions become increasingly reckless and impulsive, leading to a downward spiral.
* The reader sees the toll this takes on Mike, with him experiencing fear, anxiety, and despair.

**Themes**

The story explores several themes:

1. **The Power of the Past**: The narrative highlights how past traumas can affect individuals in lasting ways.
2. **Obsession and Addiction**: Mike's fixation on hotel rooms becomes an all-consuming force that takes over his life.
3. **Mental Health**: The story touches on Mike's struggles with mental health, particularly anxiety and depression.

**Symbolism**

Hotel rooms serve as a symbol for the unknown, the unexplored, and the unsettling. They represent a space where Mike's fears and anxieties reside.

* The brick wall in Chapter 2-3 serves as a physical representation of the walls that divide him.
* The disappearance of the bedroom window represents Mike's attempt to escape his own psychological issues.
* The blackout of time jumps (Chapters 4-5) symbolize Mike's disconnection from reality and his increasing despair.

**Writing Style**

The narrative is written in a straightforward, omniscient voice. The use of short sentences and phrases creates a sense of urgency and immediacy. However, this style can be overwhelming at times, making it difficult to follow the story.

* The narrative often employs flashbacks and dream-like sequences, which can create a sense of disorientation.
* The dialogue is sparse but effective in conveying Mike's emotions and thoughts.

**Conclusion**

The provided text is a psychological horror story that explores themes of obsession, mental health, and the power of the past. While the writing style is sometimes overwhelming, it creates a sense of tension and foreboding throughout the narrative. The story effectively builds up to its climax, culminating in a shocking revelation about Mike's past.

Overall, this is an unsettling and thought-provoking story that will leave readers with a lasting impression.

Here's an analysis of the text:

**Structure and Style**

* The text is written in a non-linear fashion, jumping between different time periods and locations. This creates a sense of disorientation and confusion, mirroring Mike's state of mind.
* The use of flashbacks, multiple narratives, and unconventional narrative structures adds to the complexity and unease of the story.

**Themes**

* **Trauma and Loss**: The text explores themes of trauma, loss, and grief. Mike is haunted by his past, and the hotel room becomes a symbol of his emotional state.
* **Mental Health**: The story touches on mental health issues, such as anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations. Mike's interactions with Lily reveal signs of psychological distress.
* **Technology and Media**: The text critiques modern media and technology, highlighting their potential to manipulate and control individuals.

**Symbolism**

* **The Hotel Room**: The hotel room represents a liminal space, where Mike is trapped and unable to escape his emotional state. It also serves as a symbol for the fragility of human life.
* **The Computer Screen**: The computer screen becomes a catalyst for Mike's descent into madness. It represents the blurred lines between reality and technology, and the dangers of unchecked influence.
* **The Camera**: The camera appears multiple times throughout the text, often used to represent the voyeuristic nature of media consumption.

**Character Development**

* **Mike**: Mike is portrayed as a complex character struggling with his own mental health. His interactions with Lily reveal a deep-seated sense of vulnerability and desperation.
* **Lily**: Lily is introduced as Mike's ex-wife, but her presence also raises questions about the validity of their relationship. Her character serves as a manifestation of Mike's emotional state.

**Tone**

* **Unsettling**: The text has an unsettling tone, creating a sense of unease and tension. This is achieved through the use of unconventional narrative structures and the manipulation of language.
* **Nervous**: The story conveys a nervous atmosphere, as if the author is trying to convey the characters' inner turmoil.

**Symbolic Representation**

* **Lily's Face**: Lily's face appears throughout the text, often in a distorted or surreal manner. This represents Mike's fragmented state of mind and his attempts to connect with the past.
* **The Water Sprinklers**: The emergency sprinklers activate, symbolizing the uncontrollable nature of water as a metaphor for Mike's emotional turmoil.

**Style**

* **Experimentation**: The text employs unconventional narrative structures, such as multiple storylines and non-linear storytelling. This experimentation creates a sense of disorientation and challenges the reader's expectations.
* **Language Play**: The author uses language play to convey the characters' emotional states. For example, Mike's use of phrases like "Fuck" and "Dolphin Hotel" adds to the overall sense of unease.

Overall, this text is a complex, unsettling, and thought-provoking exploration of human emotions, trauma, and mental health.

**EXTREME EMOTION**

The camera lingers on Mike's terror-stricken face before cutting to black.

Here is the rewritten text with the same process applied:

ON THE TABLES
A figure lies on the table, covered in blood and broken glass. The figure slowly comes back to life as a man with sunken eyes and a twisted smile.

THE MAN
whispers to himself
Fix it.
He pulls back in disgust and fear.
THE OTHER GUY
jumps up from his seat

The man lunges forward, Freakily gurgling, "Fix the machine! Fix the machine!"

THE MAN
barrels through the tiny space. Rushing for his life.
THE OTHER GUY SKITTERS after him.

He races down the LEFT VENT and makes it to the MAIN VENT. There, he sees the OPENING to 1408, a slim square of light.

THE OTHER GUY
keeps CRUSHING! Metal SMASHING closer—

MIKE
crawls like hell! Faster, towards the MAIN VENT

Where in the distance he can see the OPENING to 1408. A slim square of light — THE OTHER VENT keeps CRUSHING!

MIKE's FEET scurry as fast as they can.

SLAM! The Other Guy STABS his needle into Mike's leg.
MIKE SCREAMS, pained.

He KICKS backward. His foot SHUSHES through the Other Guy's head, like a sponge.

The Other Guy collapses, the CRUSHING VENT SQUEEZING him out of view.

MIKE speeds faster. Room 1408 visible — The CRUSHING, TWISTING METAL is now inches away — As Mike HURLS himself forward...

INT. 1408 - SAME TIME
52

...and falls through the vent into the room.

SLAM!!! He bounces off the desk, hitting the ground — as the sheet metal Vent BUCKLES CLOSED. BAM!!!

TIGHT — Mike lies there, overwhelmed. Breathing in fits, face drenched in sweat, absolutely dumbstruck.

He looks up at the ceiling... then around the room. Beat.

MIKE
I need a drink.
Mike staggers over to the Mini-Bar. He whips open the little refrigerator door - then gasps.

INSIDE THE MINI-BAR is a miniature set of OLIN'S OFFICE. A TINE LITTLE OPEN SIDE IN HIS WING-CHAIR, sipping Cognac.

MIKE grimaces, flabbergasted.

MIKE
What are you doing in there??
(vexed)
Where's my Booze?!

OLIN
I was just checking, sir. Are your accommodations exceeding your expectations?

MIKE
You know Goddamn Well they are: What do you want from me?!

OLIN
No no no. What do you want, Mr. Enslin? You sought this room.

MIKE
I was doing my job!
OLIN
(like he misheard)
Sorry?

82.
MIKE
My job! I'm a writer! I tell people the truth!

Hm. Olin swirls his Cognac.

OLIN
That's right, you don't believe in anything. You like shattering people's hopes.

MIKE
That's bullshit!
OLIN
Why do people believe in ghosts? For fun? No. They want the promise of something after death...

A COLLAGE of tearful VOICES...
SORROWFUL VOICE #1
She's in a better place, Mike...

SORROWFUL VOICE #2
She was in so much pain ,..
SORROWFUL VOICE #3
I'm sure she's smiling down at us right now...

MIKE winces, agonized.

OLIN
How many spirits have you broken?

MIKE
AAAAAAH!
Enraged, Mike SLAMS shut the Mini-Bar.

MIKE
I WANT MY DRINK!!
WIDE

Mike spins. He looks around, then spots the Cognac in the bedroom. Ah! He beelines for the bottle, then snatches it up.

He uncorks it and thirstily chugs the drink.
Pause — then he calms. He glances down at the hotel Bible.
Curious, Mike picks it up, then flips through.

83.
INSERT - BIBLE
The pages are all now blank.

Weird.

MIKE
frowns. Then, a faraway voice...

GRACIE (V.O.)
Why is our bible purple?!

Mike looks up.

There is a spectral FLASHBACK VISION:

The Enslin family’s old apartment, set-up as a grim hospice.
Gracie lies in bed, in a pink butterfly nightgown, in the final, terrible stages of cancer. She’s skeletal. Waxen.

Lily sits by her, gripping a purple Bible. She laughs awkwardly.

LILY
I — I dunno. It was a wedding present.

(she caresses it)
But it's nice. The cover is real leather...

GRACIE
Are there people where I'm going?
LILY
You're not going anywhere.
GRACIE
That isn’t what Daddy said.

We reveal Young Mike sitting in the window, smoking a cigarette. He stubs out the smoke.

YOUNG MIKE
Daddy says a lot of stupid things.

(he comes over to the bed)
You're too young to understand, but when you grow up and become an adult...

(he forces a smile)

82.
OLIN
...you'll realize I'm crazy.

Grade giggles. Mike gently brushes her cheek.

GRACIE
Daddy, everyone dies.
A tense pause.

Lily glances at Mike. He struggles to be consoling.

YOUNG MIKE
You're right. Everyone dies...

LILY
(she jumps in)
And then you'll go to a better place. And lots of people will be there...
(her voice cracks)

Grade looks up at Mike.

GRACIE
Do you believe that, Daddy...?
A profound silence. He stammers, stuck.

YOUNG MIKE
I... I...

Grade stares pleadingly.

Waiting. Then —
YOUNG MIKE
Yes. I do.
GRACIE
(she breaks into a smile)

...
CUT TO:
ANOTHER VISION
Flames RAGE. It's a cremation.
A tiny coffin enters the burning fire.

84.
PRESENT - MIKE
He sobs, pained. Wincing at this memory.

FLASHBACK VISION
The crematorium glows white, then blazes piercingly hot.
The casket disappears into the heat.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER FLASHBACK

Young Mike sits on Grade's bed, weeping. He's unshaven, distraught, clinging to her old pink nightgown.

Grade is gone.

Lily can't even look at him.

YOUNG MIKE
She could have hung on. But we had to fill her head! With all those fucking stories about the glorious afterlife...

LILY
(crying)
Why do you have to blame anyone?!

Mike throws down the nightie.

YOUNG MIKE
I gotta get out.
He jumps up and charges out of the apartment. SIAM!

CUT TO:
INT. 1408 - PRESENT
53

...MIKE breaks down, devastated.

He slumps back against the wall, whispering to himself.

MIKE
Grade...

He holds his gut, a terrible ache that will never leave.

A sorrowful silence... an emptiness... until —
82.
 CLICK.
 Mike turns, startled. His MINI-RECORDER has clicked into PLAY.

Its wheels spin...
MIKE'S RECORDED VOICE
"Heyz there's nothing to feel guilty about. When a couple loses a child, 80% of the time, they end up divorced --"
