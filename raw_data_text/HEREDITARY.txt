INT. WORKSHOP - MORNING
1
1
An impressive room serving as an ARTIST’S WORKSHOP. It’s 
empty, but evidence of frantic creative activity abounds.
We PAN across the wall, crossing a series of meticulously 
hand-crafted DOLLHOUSES, mostly works in progress. As we 
drift past these unfinished dioramas, our trajectory becomes 
clearer...
We are moving in on an extraordinary sculpture of a 
beautiful, rustic CRAFTSMAN HOME, at 1:8 scale. Its front 
wall has been removed, exposing its rooms in graphic 
tableaux. This huge miniature is painstakingly detailed. It’s 
adorned with shrunken props/decorations (flashlights, pill 
bottles, shoes, etc.) and teensy furniture, all flawlessly 
rendered and distinguishable ONLY IN SIZE from their full-
scale models.
We continue to pan/track across the miniature, edging CLOSER 
AND CLOSER as we drift along its tiny rooms. We finally 
arrive at a miniature replica of a TEENAGE BOY’S BEDROOM on 
the second floor.
We push towards this until the ROOM FILLS THE FRAME. The 
bright morning sun beams in through its window. It becomes 
apparent that a handsome, skinny BOY is sleeping in the bed.
This is PETER GRAHAM (17).
We continue pushing gently in, remaining in a wide of the 
room (whose status as a miniature has now been confused). The 
door opens and STEVE GRAHAM (47) - tall, broad-shouldered, 
formal - pops his head in. He wears a black suit.
STEVE
All right, Petey. Wake up time.
Peter stirs awake. Steve drops a folded-up BLACK SUIT AND TIE 
on the foot of the bed.
STEVE
Here’s your suit.
MAX, the family’s golden retriever, shuffles happily in 
through the door.
STEVE
Did your sister sleep in her room 
last night?
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - SAME TIME

2.
Wide on the house, revealing that it is IDENTICAL to the 
miniature that we saw in the workshop. The surrounding 
landscape is blanketed with SNOW.
Steve exits a back door to approach a very large TREEHOUSE.
It is joined to a sturdy oak and hovers fifteen feet above 
the ground. We are subtly BOOMING DOWN from this wide view 
(as Steve begins to climb the tree) to arrive at a parked CAR 
- one of two family cars - in the foreground.
Sitting in the passenger seat is a bereaved woman (45). She 
wears all black, and is beautiful in a worn way. This is 
ANNIE GRAHAM, and she looks emotionally exhausted.
She wears a delicate NECKLACE bearing an ORNATE SIGIL, which 
she compulsively fingers.
EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME

Steve pokes his head into the treehouse, where he finds: 
CHARLIE - a plump, androgynous fourteen year old girl - lying 
asleep on the floor. She wears a parka and pajama bottoms.
Beside her is a DRAWING PAD and an open SHOEBOX.
STEVE
Oh my God, Charlie. Are you crazy?
Charlie wakes up, her nose pink and runny. When she notices 
Steve, she frantically reaches to SHUT the shoebox.
STEVE
This is how you get pneumonia!
CHARLIE
(getting up)
It’s okay.
STEVE
Your mom’s in the car already, 
we’re late.
INT. FUNERAL HOME - CHAPEL - MORNING
4
4
A moderately attended FUNERAL. (A large group of MEN AND 
WOMEN observe from the back.)
Before the altar, an OPEN CASKET rests beside a blown up 
photo of the deceased ELLEN LEIGH, Annie’s 75 year old 
mother.
3.
Annie, Steve, Charlie (now wearing an oversized black dress 
over her pajama bottoms) and Peter sit in the first row of 
chairs. They listen as a LARGE WOMAN (60s) speaks in 
remembrance of Ellen.
LARGE WOMAN
Ellen was a tough one. She didn't 
mince words, she abhorred the 
sentimental, and she was honest. 
And I know that's how she raised 
her children, Annie and Charles -
LARGE WOMAN
(uncomfortably)
- may he rest in peace... To always 
be honest...
Half-listening (half-wincing), Annie’s attention is drawn to 
CHARLIE, who makes a quiet CLICKING noise with her tongue.
This is a tic.
Suddenly, a bird FLAPS out from the rafters, startling the 
congregation.
The bird settles on a ceiling perch. It is a WHIPPOORWILL. It 
looks down, fixing its gaze on Annie. Annie looks very 
disturbed. Off-screen, the Large Woman continues.
MINUTES LATER
Annie is now on the PLATFORM.
ANNIE
I just wanna say first...it’s very 
heartening to see so many strange 
new faces here today. I know my mom 
would be very touched
(and probably a little 
suspicious)
if she could see this turn-out, 
so...
Annie looks down to now read from a heavily edited loose-leaf 
page. This is her eulogy. (Not used to reading in public, she 
rarely looks up from the paper.)
ANNIE
4.
My mother was an intensely 
secretive and private woman. She 
had private rituals, private 
friends, private anxieties... It 
honestly feels like a betrayal just 
to be standing here talking about 
her...
Annie pauses. She looks at the paragraph. It’s very long, and 
begins with the sentence “My mother was a chameleon.” She 
decides to skip ahead to the next paragraph.
ANNIE
She was a very difficult woman to 
read. If you ever thought you knew 
what was going on with her - and 
God forbid you tried to confront 
that...!
(stops...pauses...skips 
ahead)
...But when her life was 
unpolluted, she could easily be the 
sweetest, warmest, most loving 
person in the world...
Charlie is DRAWING a weepy caricature of Annie at the 
platform. Steve watches this in the corner of his eye.
ANNIE
(pauses, skips again to 
the next paragraph)
...She was also incredibly 
stubborn. Which maybe explains me.
Scattered, knowing laughter.
ANNIE
You could always count on her to 
always have the answer....
She stops short, eyes on the paper. The sentence would 
continue “and if she ever WAS mistaken - well, that was YOUR 
opinion and you were WRONG.”
Suddenly remorseful, Annie (off-book) asserts:
ANNIE
I did love her.
Charlie is still drawing. Steve closes the notepad. He points 
to Annie: “Listen to your mother.” Charlie grudgingly 
obliges.
ANNIE
5.
She was especially strong about 
food. When I was a girl and I had 
to eat my veggies...
LATER
The mourners have been invited up to view the deceased and 
say goodbye. Organ music plays as Annie, Steve, Peter (who 
doesn’t look) and Charlie shuffle by.
Charlie peers into the open casket to see her grandmother’s 
CORPSE. It wears a NECKLACE with a delicate SIGIL ORNAMENT 
(identical to Annie’s). The seams in the corpse’s make-up are 
eerily apparent and the lips are slightly twisted.
Unnerved, Charlie looks away. She meets eyes with a smiling 
MIDDLE-AGED BLONDE MAN standing in the queue behind her. He’s 
STARING at her - an overly sentimental look in his eyes.
Disturbed, Charlie averts her eyes. “Yeesh.”
SECONDS LATER
An older WOMAN arrives at the open casket. Her finger is 
dipped into a small bottle of OIL. She quickly and covertly 
STREAKS the oil along the corpse’s lips.
Seeing this, a following mourner squints with bewilderment.
INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
5
5
Steve is at the wheel, driving back home. Annie sits 
passenger, and Peter and Charlie sit in the back. They drive 
past a gathering of DEER.
ANNIE
(to Steve)
How did you keep from screaming 
during Judy’s speech?
STEVE
Ha. Well, if you could...!
Peter EYES the back of Annie’s head. She seems to grate on 
his nerves. Meanwhile, Charlie is back to making clicking 
noises with her tongue. She does this while unwrapping a 
CHOCOLATE BAR.
ANNIE
(to Steve)
How about that bird flying in?
STEVE
6.
Yeah, that was weird.
ANNIE
That was too weird. The timing? It 
felt like it was my mom.
Steve nods, betraying a look of CONCERN. Annie self-
consciously backtracks:
ANNIE
Not actually, obviously. Just - it 
struck me.
Annie notices Charlie eating the chocolate bar.
ANNIE
Hey! Are there nuts in that?
CHARLIE
No!
ANNIE
Better not be.
Annie returns her attention to the road. Steve lovingly takes 
her hand. She smiles at him.
Charlie, irritated, looks very tense.
CHARLIE
(quietly)
I don’t like going back without 
grandma.
STEVE
(carefully)
Well, sweetie...do you understand 
why we have to?
Charlie just tenses up, eyes narrowing onto the floor.
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - FOYER - EVENING
6
6
The house is unlit and seemingly vacant.
Off-screen, we hear FEET SCURRYING and a DOOR CLOSING. Max, 
the golden retriever, BARKS in reaction to this.
A moment later, the front door opens and the Graham family 
enters. They stamp the snow off their boots and remove their 
coats.
7.
Max runs up, desperate to greet them. Steve bends down to 
happily receive him.
Charlie moves toward the stairs, still wearing her boots.
STEVE
Hey hey -- shoes off.
Charlie pulls off her boots. She and Peter start separately 
up the stairs. Steve, looking down, notices dried FOOT-PRINTS 
around the foyer.
STEVE
(calling out)
See? What’s with all these 
footprints? I’m tired of reminding 
everybody.
INT. WORKSHOP - EVENING
7
7
Annie is at her work desk. It’s a mess of paints, props, wood 
pieces, etc. She wears magnifying eye-glasses as she 
carefully paints eyes onto a SMALL DOCTOR FIGURINE for a 
MINIATURE HOSPICE. A figurine of an old woman - presumably 
Annie’s mother - lies in a miniature hospital bed.
Steve enters, disrupting Annie’s focus.
STEVE
How’s it going?
ANNIE
Just working.
Steve casually rests a glass of water and a PILL on the 
table. She downs it without question.
STEVE
Still toiling on the hospice?
ANNIE
Between that and the pre-school.
There is a half-finished MINIATURE PRE-SCHOOL in the corner.
STEVE
How far are we now? Seven months?
ANNIE
Six and a half.
STEVE
Yow. Comin’ up.
8.
Her eyes widen with stress.
STEVE
Any title ideas yet?
Annie grabs her laptop and pulls up a PDF for a poster 
promoting an upcoming EXHIBITION of her artwork. It features 
a photo of a magnificent living room miniature. Below this 
are the words “TITLE HERE” in bold, followed by “The Work of 
Annie Leigh.”
ANNIE
This is the photo they wanna use.
STEVE
Ooh, I love that one.
ANNIE
The gallery owner keeps suggesting 
Your Life in Miniature for the 
title.
STEVE
What do you think of that?
Annie looks at him, incredulous. “Are you serious?”
STEVE
No good?
ANNIE
It’s horrible!
STEVE
(conceding)
Yeah. A little trite.
ANNIE
A lot trite! Are you kidding? She 
won’t stop suggesting it!
Steve looks to a stack of LARGE MOVING BOXES in the corner.
They’re marked “Mom’s Things” in Annie’s handwriting.
STEVE
You want me to put that stuff in 
the attic?
ANNIE
...Yeah. Maybe not just yet.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
8
8
9.
Peter sits up in bed, holding a guitar. He improvises a 
clunky tune as a muted TV plays cartoons. His eyes are on the 
TV.
The door cracks open and Steve pokes his head in.
STEVE
Goodnight, kiddo.
PETER
‘Night, dad.
STEVE
...What you playing?
PETER
Just plucking random strings.
STEVE
(nods, then)
You feeling okay about everything?
PETER
(shrugs)
Yeah. Fine.
STEVE
Little sad?
Peter shrugs again. He clearly wasn’t fond of Ellen.
STEVE
Yeah. I know.
(pause)
Okay, buddy. Love you.
Steve KISSES in Peter’s direction. Peter kisses back. Steve 
walks off, leaving the door open.
A moment later, Annie walks up to the doorway, still wearing 
her magnifying eye-glasses. She’s holding a prop in one hand, 
a fine paintbrush in the other.
ANNIE
‘Night sweetheart.
PETER
Goodnight. I’m sorry about your 
mom.
ANNIE
(pause)
Thank you. I’m sorry about your 
grandma.
10.
PETER
...Thank you.
Annie smiles, hesitates, and walks off. There’s a very loaded 
tension between these two.
After Annie is gone, Peter climbs out of bed to shut the 
door. He LOCKS it.
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
9
9
Charlie’s room is that of a young artist. The walls are 
covered in drawings, and the desks and other surfaces are 
littered with different HANDMADE HUMAN MANIKINS and SMALL 
STATUES (all made of disparate parts - mostly found objects).
Annie sits on the edge of Charlie’s bed. Charlie is under the 
covers. Annie has opened Charlie’s drawing pad to see a 
CARICATURE of Annie’s mother’s corpse in its casket.
ANNIE
That’s grandma?
CHARLIE
I dunno.
ANNIE
You know you were her favorite?
CHARLIE
(looking away)
No I wasn’t.
ANNIE
(pouncing)
Oh yes you absolutely were! Even 
when you were a little baby, she 
wouldn’t let me feed you because 
she needed to feed you. It drove me 
crazy.
CHARLIE
She said I was supposed to be a 
boy.
Annie knows this. She hesitates, wanting to say the right 
thing.
ANNIE
How do you feel about that?
Charlie shrugs.
11.
ANNIE
You know I was a tomboy growing up? 
I hated dresses and dolls and pink.
Charlie’s heard this before. She has tensed up.
CHARLIE
(looking away, quietly)
Who’s gonna take care of me?
ANNIE
(mock offended)
Ummm, excuse me? You don’t think 
I’m gonna take care of you?!
CHARLIE
But when you die...
ANNIE
...Then dad will take care of you. 
Or Peter.
Charlie’s head remains turned. Discouraged, Annie turns back 
the page of the drawing pad. She now sees the caricature of 
her, crying at the pulpit.
ANNIE
Who’s this one?
No answer. Annie takes it personally, but pretends not to.
She closes the book with a smile.
ANNIE
You never even cried as a baby - 
you know that? Not even when you 
were born.
Charlie ignores this.
ANNIE
Did you feel like you wanted to cry 
today?
Without looking at Annie, Charlie shrugs a tense “I don’t 
know.”
ANNIE
Do you think that might feel like a 
relief?
Charlie remains miles away.
12.
Annie looks up to notice that a difficult-to-read WORD (looks 
like “Satony”) has been CARVED into the wall behind Charlie’s 
bed. Annie pauses, lets it go, and then bends down to KISS 
Charlie’s forehead.
ANNIE
Goodnight, sweetie.
INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT
10
10
Annie enters. Outside the window: peaceful snowfall.
Annie hesitates before walking over to the box labeled “Mom’s 
Things.” She reluctantly opens it...
The box is filled with bottled oils and herbs. At the top of 
the box is a PHOTO ALBUM titled “Memories.” Annie opens it to 
sift through photos of her mother. She lays the album back 
into the box, and then notices a stack of worn HARDBACKS. She 
pulls one out. “NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM.”
This calls back unwelcome memories. Annie dumps the book back 
into the box, and PUSHES the box away.
Annie walks to the door and flips off the light, leaving the 
room in darkness (save for the moonlight). She’s about to 
leave, but something makes her FREEZE.
Standing motionless in a dark corner (almost too dark to make 
out) is ANNIE’S MOTHER, ELLEN - wearing the same outfit as 
the funeral. She’s staring at Annie. SMILING.
Annie, nearly paralyzed with fear, reaches for the light 
switch. Without looking away, she turns the light back ON.
Her mother is gone.
Annie remains motionless.
ANNIE
(a whisper)
Mom?
Annie’s eyes are now drawn to...
A dusty older MINIATURE in the corner. It's a replica of 
Annie's bedroom. A figurine of Annie (in her early thirties) 
BREASTFEEDS a baby. Standing beside her is a figurine of an 
OLDER WOMAN (Annie’s mother) holding her naked BREAST out of 
her nightgown. She leans over, offering it to the baby.
Competing with Annie.
13.
Troubled by this, Annie walks briskly to the miniature and 
TURNS it away. It’s now facing the wall as Annie returns to 
the door, flicks off the light, and leaves.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
11
11
Annie climbs into bed with Steve.
ANNIE
I just scared myself in the 
workshop.
STEVE
Oh no. With what?
Annie pauses. Thinks about telling him. Steve looks 
interested/slightly worried. Annie thinks better of it.
STEVE
...No?
She smiles “nah.”
ANNIE
Goodnight.
Annie turns off the bedside lamp and gives Steve a blunt 
kiss.
STEVE
(before she can pull 
away)
Mm, mm - no you don’t.
He EXTENDS the kiss, making it last. Then:
STEVE
Goodnight.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - NEXT MORNING
12
12
Charlie’s “special needs” class.
Scrawled on the blackboard are the words “Quiet means 
Silence!” and all the students are indeed silent as they take 
a quiz.
The TEACHER (40s) walks along the rows of desks, overlooking 
the quiz-takers. He comes to CHARLIE, whose quiz is upside-
down. In her lap, she is assembling a small manikin’s body 
with disparate found objects (wood, metal, cardboard, etc).
14.
TEACHER
Are you done?
CHARLIE
(looking up, startled)
What? ...Almost.
TEACHER
(warmly)
So maybe we finish the toy after 
the quiz? What do you think?
CHARLIE
...Okay.
The teacher gently turns the quiz right-side-up. Charlie is 
extremely tense through this.
Suddenly a PIGEON flies into the window, slamming its head.
The impact breaks its neck.
The classroom erupts with excitement - “Oh my God!” “Did you 
see that?!” - but not Charlie. She stares tensely at her 
desk, still disturbed by the teacher’s interference.
Charlie’s EYES scan up. They alight on a pair of SCISSORS on 
the Teacher’s desk.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
13
13
Peter’s English class. The chalkboard reads:
Themes
- Escaping Fate.
- Relationship between knowledge and responsibility.
- "No man considered fortunate until he is dead."
The teacher, MR. DAVIES (30s), tries to facilitate a group 
discussion. He holds a copy of Sophocles’ The Women of 
Trachis.
MR. DAVIES
So if we're going by the rule that 
a hero is undone by his fatal flaw, 
what was Heracles’ flaw?
SMART-ASS STUDENT
Fucking his mom.
15.
Some laughter from the class.
MR. DAVIES
Wrong play, Sam. And watch your 
language.
Meanwhile, Peter is being hypnotized by BRIDGET (17), the 
attractive girl sitting in front of him. Peter’s rapt 
attention is glued to the butt of her jeans.
MR. DAVIES
Come on, guys: What was Heracles’ 
flaw?
Bridget now speaks up:
BRIDGET
Arrogance.
This piques Peter’s interest.
MR. DAVIES
Okay - why?
BRIDGET
Because he literally refuses to 
look at all the signs that are 
being literally handed to him the 
entire play.
Peter’s in love.
MR. DAVIES
Okay, interesting! So he thinks he 
has control.
SMART-ASS STUDENT
Plus he fucked his mom.
More laughs.
MR. DAVIES
(to the smart-ass)
That’s two strikes, Sam.
(back to the class)
But also, don’t forget: Sophocles 
writes it so the oracle is 
unconditional. Meaning Heracles 
never had any choice. Right?
Peter’s smartphone VIBRATES with a text.
MR. DAVIES
16.
So, does this make it more tragic 
or less tragic than if he did have 
a choice?
STUDENT #2
Less!
Peter checks his text. It’s from Brendan. It reads: “Wanna 
smoke a bowl at break?” This came from the BOY behind him.
MR. DAVIES
Okay: Why?
STUDENT #2
(already giving up)
Because!
Mr. Davies turns to Peter, who’s now composing a text in his 
lap.
MR. DAVIES
Care to weigh in, Peter?
Peter looks up, a deer in headlights.
PETER
About which part?
MR. DAVIES
Is it more tragic if it’s 
inevitable than if the characters 
had agency?
Peter is not following.
PETER
Yes?
MR. DAVIES
Why?
PETER
...Because he had sex with his mom?
Dead air. Mr. Davies gives Peter an unencouraging look.
Another student picks up the slack:
STUDENT #3
17.
I think it's more tragic - because 
if it’s all just inevitable, that 
means the characters have no hope 
and that they never had hope, 
because they’re just like pawns in 
this horrible, hopeless machine.
Peter has now noticed BRIDGET looking at him. She gives him a 
sardonic “nice try” smile. Peter smiles back, embarrassed.
She turns away. Peter’s smile turns to a longing stare.
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY
14
14
Recess.
The DEAD PIGEON lies pathetically in the bushes below 
Charlie’s classroom window.
Charlie stands nearby, staring at the pigeon. After some 
time, she fishes a pair of SCISSORS from her parka pocket.
(These are the scissors from her teacher’s desk.) Charlie 
extends the scissors, fits the blades around the pigeon’s 
neck, and SNIPS OFF ITS HEAD.
Charlie quickly POCKETS the pigeon head, and looks up to 
notice:
An OLDER WOMAN (60s) sitting on a bench, just beyond the 
schoolyard fence. She is gazing at Charlie, sentimental.
Charlie gawks at the woman, unnerved. Without breaking eye 
contact, she pulls a chocolate bar from her pocket.
In the b.g., PETER walks past, joined by Brendan. Seeing the 
chocolate, Peter casually asserts:
PETER
No nuts, Charlie.
This makes Charlie freeze up with tension.
INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
15
15
Steve’s office is large and sparsely decorated.
Steve sits in a leather chair with a notepad resting on his 
lap. Sitting opposite him is an extremely agitated, depressed 
female PATIENT (40s). Steve studies her non-judgmentally.
STEVE
18.
And how’s the anger?
PATIENT
Same. I just don’t care as much.
STEVE
(optimistic)
So not as consuming?
PATIENT
(gritted teeth)
It’s just as consuming, I just 
don’t care as much.
Steve, stifling frustration, affects superhuman patience.
STEVE
And how’s your appetite been? With 
the Serafem...versus the Lexapro.
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - DAY
16
16
Annie’s laptop is open to a website: “Discernment of Presumed 
Apparitions.”
Annie, sitting at the Graham house model, is carefully 
painting a MINIATURE LAPTOP, featuring the very same website.
INT. ANNIE’S MOTHER’S BEDROOM - DAY
17
17
We are looking through the open door into the HALL.
Downstairs, the front door is heard opening.
STEVE (O.S.)
Hello!
ANNIE (O.S.)
Hi!
Annie steps out into the hall and walks past the doorway. A 
moment later, we hear her footsteps FREEZE. She soon returns 
into view, now looking very unsettled. She stares past us, 
into the room...
ANNIE’S POV: The room is mostly EMPTY, save for the bed 
(stripped of sheets), a bookshelf, and various FRAMED PHOTOS 
featuring members of the family. One photo: a portrait of 
Annie and her mother, standing side by side. There is also a 
LARGE TRIANGLE (pointed northwest) that has been CARVED 
violently into the floorboards.
19.
Annie doesn’t react to the triangle. It was clearly already 
there.
Annie leaves.
INT. TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
18
18
Steve sits on the couch, having just turned on the news. He’s 
still wearing his coat.
Annie enters.
ANNIE
Were you in my mom’s room?
STEVE
What? No.
ANNIE
The door was open.
Steve makes a “hmm” face.
The front door is heard opening, and Annie goes to the FOYER, 
where Peter and Charlie are entering.
ANNIE
Hey guys. How was school?
PETER
Okay.
ANNIE
Did either of you go into Grandma’s 
room recently?
They both squint. “Why would we go in there?”
PETER
I don’t think you need to worry 
about me ever being in that room.
INT. HALLWAY - EVENING
19
19
Steve is at Annie’s Mother’s door. He LOCKS IT (by key) from 
the outside.
ANNIE
Sorry. I know it’s irrational.
STEVE
Not at all.
20.
Illustrating that it’s locked, Steve tries turning the knob.
Annie smiles.
ANNIE
Thank you.
She kisses Steve, feeling dopey.
Peter walks up to them, holding the PHONE.
PETER
Dad?
(extending phone)
It’s the cemetery.
ANNIE
About what?
STEVE
I’ll see.
(into phone)
Hi... Yeah...
Steve walks down the hall to create distance between him and 
Annie. Now irked, Annie walks off.
STEVE
(into phone, warily)
Okay.... And what does “desecrated” 
mean?
(listens, then - shocked)
What? It's only been a week.
ANNIE steps back into the hall, now wearing a coat. Steve 
nervously accelerates:
STEVE
(into phone)
Okay. All right. Can I actually 
call you back?... Okay, fine.
Steve hangs up.
ANNIE
I’m gonna go see a movie.
STEVE
Okay. Right now?
ANNIE
I think I just need to get out of 
the house for a second.
21.
STEVE
...Want me to join?
ANNIE
(hesitates)
I think I might just need like an 
hour to myself. I’m really tense.
STEVE
Okay...great. I think you should.
Annie smiles “thanks.”
ANNIE
Do you know where Charlie is?
STEVE
Where else?
Annie knows what that means. She immediately looks 
frustrated.
STEVE
Let it go. It’s wasted energy. 
ANNIE
It’s below 30 outside! So let her 
catch a cold.
STEVE
Maybe she needs one.
INT. TREEHOUSE - EVENING
20
20
Charlie sits in her treehouse. She lays the severed pigeon 
head into her SHOEBOX. Inside this box are three other 
SEVERED ANIMAL HEADS. One belongs to a rabbit, one to a rat, 
one to a squirrel. (The heads are in different stages of 
decomposition; flies buzz about.)
Down below, Annie is heard:
ANNIE (O.S.)
Charlie?
Charlie shuts the box, SHOVES it into a corner, and peers 
down to see ANNIE at the tree’s base.
ANNIE
Come on, sweetie. It’s freezing out 
here.
No response from Charlie. Annie doesn’t push it.
22.
ANNIE
Okay, well, I’m running out for a 
sec. Is there anything I can bring 
you back?
CHARLIE
(defensively)
Why??
INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
21
21
Annie idles into the parking lot of a Catholic high school.
She parks, turns off the engine, and sits in silence for a 
moment. Bracing herself.
INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
22
22
A SUPPORT GROUP held in the high school’s gymnasium. A sign 
on an easel reads “LOSING A LOVED ONE, Grief Recovery.” The 
session hasn’t yet started. Twenty empty chairs form a CIRCLE 
in the space’s center.
Mourners of varying affect are scattered about, mingling.
Annie ENTERS, very ill-at-ease.
THIRTY MINUTES LATER
All the chairs are now filled. A middle-aged MEXICAN WOMAN 
speaks (in Spanish) through coursing tears. A YOUNG MAN 
translates for her as the rest of the group listens.
YOUNG MAN
(translating between her 
sentences)
Sometimes I even get so relieved... 
Because he was in so much pain, and 
by the end he just hated himself. 
Always saying “I’m a burden, I’m a 
burden, I’m a burden”...
Annie’s eyes are wide. She’s empathizing with this, but it 
seems to also be agitating her.
FIVE MINUTES LATER
The GROUP LEADER addresses the group.
LEADER
23.
We’ve set aside some time for any 
newcomers who might like to 
speak...
Silence.
LEADER
So, anybody new - if it’s your 
first or second time with us: the 
floor is open.
Annie looks very torn. She starts to lift up her hand, but 
stops short.
LEADER
(gesturing to Annie)
Yes?
Annie looks panicked.
LEADER
Would you like to...?
ANNIE
...Maybe not.
LEADER
Okay. No pressure.
Annie nods, takes a long moment, and then forces herself:
ANNIE
My name’s Annie.
THE GROUP
Hi Annie.
Annie strains a smile. She continues tensely, as if against 
her will:
ANNIE
My mom died a week ago, so I’m just 
here for - trying it. I have a lot 
of resistance to things like this, 
but I went to these a couple years 
ago - I was pressured to come - but 
it did help, so...
(long pause)
24.
My mom was old and she wasn’t all 
together at the end - and we were 
pretty much estranged before that - 
so it wasn’t a huge blow. But I did 
love her. And she didn’t have an 
easy life... She had D.I.D., which 
became extreme in the last year, 
and dementia...! My dad died of 
starvation when I was a baby. He 
had psychotic depression and he 
starved himself. Which I’m sure was 
as pleasant as it sounds. And then 
my older brother - he was 
schizophrenic - and when he was 
sixteen, he hanged himself in my 
mom’s bedroom.
ANNIE
Of course his suicide note blamed 
her. Accusing her of putting people 
inside of him.
(throws hands up)
So that was my mom’s life!
Annie looks to the group. They allow her time to continue.
She reluctantly proceeds.
ANNIE
...She finally lived in our house 
at the end. Before hospice. We 
weren’t talking before that -- or 
we were and then we weren’t and 
then we were - she was completely 
manipulative - until finally my 
husband enforced a No Contact rule, 
which lasted until I was pregnant 
with my daughter. I didn't let her 
near me when I had my first - my 
son - which is why I gave her my 
daughter, who she immediately 
stabbed her hooks into. And of 
course I felt guilty again when she 
got sick... Not that she was even 
my mom at the end. And not that she 
ever felt guilty. About anything.
Annie has worked herself up. A charged pause as she calms 
back down.
ANNIE
And I don’t wanna put any more 
stress on my family. Not even sure 
if they could give me that support.
25.
She gets stuck here. Tears begin to well. She struggles to 
squeeze out the following:
ANNIE
It just all sometimes feels ruined. 
And then I realize I'm to blame. Or 
not that I'm to blame, but that 
I'm...blamed.
Beat.
LEADER
And what do you think you feel 
blamed for?
Annie looks to the leader. Pauses.
ANNIE
I apparently acted a certain way - 
according to them - I did things, 
in my sleep, a couple years ago. Or 
almost did them...
Annie looks like she’s going to continue, but then she 
abruptly cuts herself off. That’s it.
We reveal the mystified GROUP. They struggle to remain 
sympathetic, despite their confusion.
ANNIE
So anyway. Everything’s 
disappointing. So here I am.
She forces a laugh, but also cries a bit. She wipes away the 
tears and makes an embarrassed “bah” face. She then motions 
to the group: “Who’s next?”
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
23
23
At the end of the hall, a very depleted Annie has just 
finished scaling the stairs.
In the f.g., Peter’s door eases shut.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
24
24
Peter’s laptop is open. The browser displays BRIDGET’S 
FACEBOOK PAGE. (Peter has been going through her photos.) 
Behind that, another page displays “POPULAR CAREER 
INTERESTS.”
Peter walks from the door (which he just closed) to his desk.
26.
He grabs a small water pipe, packed with marijuana, and walks 
to the window.
As Peter takes a hit from his pipe, his smartphone vibrates 
with a TEXT. He checks it.
From “Brendan”:
Holy shit. Huge party tomorrow at Aaron’s house. Bring your 
dick!
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
25
25
A WIDE of the house. In the foreground seems to be someone’s 
SHOULDER.
Pot smoke is blown out of Peter’s window, followed by a brief 
fit of COUGHING.
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY
26
26
Charlie, dressed in her pajamas and munching on M&Ms, sits at 
her desk. She’s is finishing the torso for another small 
human manikin. The limbs are made of different scraps.
To the side of Charlie’s sculpture-in-progress is the SEVERED 
PIGEON HEAD. Beside that is Charlie’s drawing pad, open to an 
unfinished STILL LIFE of the pigeon head. And on the far side 
of the desk: a crude, bare stage for an unfinished DIORAMA.
As she works, Charlie makes the CLICKING SOUND with her 
tongue.
Suddenly, a GLINT of light sweeps the room in a quick FLASH.
Charlie ceases drawing. Her clicking STOPS. Disturbed by the 
flash, she raises her head and HOLDS. Listening for 
something?
After a beat, Charlie rises from her seat and walks to the 
WINDOW. It’s snowing outside. She stands there for a long 
time, her back to us. She’s STARING at something...
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
27
27
Annie is preparing dinner. Her smartphone DINGS with an 
INCOMING EMAIL. It’s from The Asher Gallery. She opens it. It 
reads:
Hi Annie!
27.
Don't want to bother you, but we’d love to see where we are 
(progress-wise). Could you possibly send us pics of your work 
in its current stage? I promise we won't judge!! ;) Annie 
looks suddenly overwhelmed.
EXT. WOODS - MINUTES LATER
28
28
The vast WOODED AREA behind the Graham house. It is still 
snowing.
Charlie, wearing regular shoes and no coat (and still dressed 
in her pajamas), takes wide steps as she slogs through the 
snow.
She gazes listlessly ahead, as if in a TRANCE. She’s being 
drawn toward something. Like she’s sleepwalking with open 
eyes.
Max, the family dog, follows happily behind. A FIRE is heard 
crackling in the distance. Is this what she’s walking toward?
We cut to an EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - almost bird’s eye. This 
reveals that Charlie seems to be following a FRESH PATH OF 
FOOTPRINTS (source unknown) leading off-screen.
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME
29
29
Annie is now WORKING INTENSELY on one of her miniatures. She 
looks very anxious.
Peter appears at the door.
PETER
Hey, uh...
Annie looks up, visibly annoyed by the disturbance.
PETER
...do you think I could borrow one 
of the cars tonight?
ANNIE
Why? Where are you going?
PETER
Oh, just like a school BBQ thing.
Annie continue working on the miniature, breaking 
intermittently as they speak:
ANNIE
28.
Does that mean you’re not having 
dinner with us?
PETER
Oh, no, I was still gonna eat here.
PETER
Well - you can eat there if you 
want.
ANNIE
No, I’ll eat here.
Annie pauses. Her mind is not quite on this right now. She 
takes a moment (pulling herself from her work) to assess the 
questions that need to be asked.
ANNIE
No drinking?
PETER
Nobody’s old enough to even get 
drinks if they wanted to.
ANNIE
Well, that’s a crock. I’m just 
asking if you’re drinking.
PETER
Well, I just answered no.
Annie looks him hard in the eye before accepting that.
ANNIE
...You gonna take your sister?
PETER
Uh - does she want to go?
ANNIE
(mimicking his tone)
Uh - have you asked her?
EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
30
30
Peter goes to Charlie’s room. She’s not there. He calls out:
PETER
Charlie?!
INT. WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER
31
31
29.
Peter returns to the workshop.
PETER
She’s not in the house.
Frustrated, Annie throws down her paintbrush:
ANNIE
What? Yes she is.
EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME
32
32
Charlie is still walking through the snow. She sees in the 
DISTANCE, almost too far away to distinguish...
A ring of BURNING TORCHES has been set up. Within this ring, 
an OLD WOMAN’S INANIMATE BODY (dead?) stands erect - tied to 
a pole, with her arms strapped to outstretched planks. The 
body is dressed in FINE WHITE SILK. It looks like Ellen Leigh 
(Charlie’s grandmother), but it’s too far away to quite tell.
Charlie squints at this, barely reacting, when--
ANNIE (O.S.)
CHARLIE!
Charlie looks to ANNIE, who is running in her direction.
Charlie steps toward Annie.
ANNIE
What are you doing?! It’s below 
freezing out here!
Annie arrives at Charlie, not seeing the distant torches. She 
seizes Charlie’s arm and starts leading her back to the 
house.
ANNIE
Are you an idiot? You can’t just 
roam around - no coat, no boots!
Charlie YANKS her arm away from Annie.
ANNIE
Oh - what? You’re angry with me?
Annie GRABS Charlie’s arm and PULLS her back toward the 
house.
CHARLIE
(under her breath)
I want grandma.
30.
ANNIE
Yeah. That makes one of us.
INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
33
33
Annie and Charlie return. Annie aggressively stamps the snow 
off her boots.
ANNIE
You’re going to this party with 
your brother.
CHARLIE
What party?
ANNIE
(trying to be softer)
A school hang-out with other kids.
CHARLIE
(evasive)
That’s okay.
ANNIE
No, it’s not okay. You’re going.
CHARLIE
Why?
ANNIE
Because it’ll be fun. You can hang 
out.
CHARLIE
With who?
ANNIE
With your brother! With other kids!
Peter has stepped into the hall. He nods, as if to say “yeah, 
come along,” but his eyes are very uninviting.
CHARLIE
(as if to challenge 
Peter)
...Fine.
ANNIE
Great. You’re going.
(to Peter)
She’s going with you.
PETER
31.
Great.
ANNIE
And that really means no drinking.
PETER
Yeah: I really wasn’t going to.
EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING
34
34
The sun has set. A FULL MOON glows pale-blue over a lonely 
highway.
The Graham family car (the green one) FLASHES past.
INT. GRAHAM FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS
35
35
Peter is tense at the wheel. He drives the speed limit.
Peter’s eyes drift to the REAR VIEW MIRROR... Charlie, 
sitting in the back, CLICKS her tongue.
Peter’s eyes narrow resentfully back onto the road.
The car passes a TELEPHONE POLE. Just an average telephone 
pole. But we HOLD on it for a second longer than feels 
necessary. Hyper-attentive viewers might notice that a small 
SIGIL has been carved into it.
EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
36
36
A large, modern house. The windows feature glimpses of a big 
party, filled with circulating kids.
Peter and Charlie walk up the driveway. Charlie, suddenly 
very nervous, starts slowing down.
CHARLIE
Maybe I don’t have to go in...
Peter stops.
PETER
Why? What’s wrong?
CHARLIE
It’s okay. I can just stay out 
here.
PETER
32.
Charlie, you’re the one who wanted 
to come.
CHARLIE
(not looking at him)
So you just go. I’ll be out here.
PETER
Charlie: If you don’t come in, I 
have to take you back home, and 
that’ll take an hour.
INT. PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
37
37
The house is bustling. In the KITCHEN, two girls pull a CAKE 
from the oven. Another girl (working on the frosting) CHOPS 
up loads of WALNUTS on a chopping board.
ECU of the nuts being brutalized.
In the LIVING ROOM, Peter stands awkwardly with Charlie.
Charlie grips her drawing pad.
AARON (17), a preppy-looking kid, walks suspiciously over to 
Peter. This is Aaron’s house.
AARON
Hey.
PETER
Hey. Nice house.
AARON
How did you hear about this?
PETER
Text.
Aaron nods, annoyed. He takes an aggressive sip of his drink.
Peter is uncomfortable.
PETER
(forcing conversation)
Your parents are out of town?
Peter suddenly spots BRIDGET across the room. She sits on the 
COUCH, obviously inebriated, nursing a beer. Completely 
alone.
AARON
33.
You didn’t bring beers or anything, 
did you?
Peter turns back to Aaron, very impatient now.
PETER
What? No.
(first thing that comes 
to mind)
I actually have to go to the 
bathroom.
Aaron nods “yeah, whatever.” Peter, already backing away, 
turns to Charlie.
PETER
Stay here one second, okay? I’m 
just going to the bathroom.
Peter starts walking. Charlie immediately follows. Peter 
feigns a trajectory toward the bathroom just behind Bridget.
As he walks, he pretends to notice her. He affects a 
surprised face.
PETER
Whoa, hey! What’s up?
BRIDGET
Oh. Hey.
Peter steps toward her. A brief pause.
PETER
How’s the party?
BRIDGET
(sarcastic)
Why? You wanna know if you should 
come?
PETER
Uh - yeah. What do you think?
BRIDGET
(shrugs)
Whatever.
PETER
Okay, maybe I will.
BRIDGET
Okay, I’ll see you here.
34.
Another awkward pause.
PETER
Do you happen to smoke at all?
BRIDGET
Smoke what?
Peter pinches into his pocket. He reveals the top of a 
rolled-up BAG OF MARIJUANA.
BRIDGET
(not seeing)
Is that tobacco or weed?
PETER
Really awesome weed.
Bridget considers, and then:
BRIDGET
(”why not?”)
I could get more high.
She stands up.
BRIDGET
The other room has a bong.
Bridget gestures for him to follow her. Peter starts to walk, 
but then notices Charlie following him.
PETER
Hey. You wanna stay out here for a 
second?
CHARLIE
Nope.
PETER
Charlie: please: Only for two 
minutes and then we can hang out. 
You can draw.
Bridget is already at the DOOR to the other room. She looks 
expectantly at Peter, who turns again (desperately) to 
Charlie.
PETER
Please Charlie, I promise. I just 
need to do something really quick.
Peter then SEES something.
35.
PETER
Oh shit. Look:
He’s pointing at the KITCHEN. The teen girls are now cutting 
into a fresh CHOCOLATE CAKE. They hand slices around.
PETER
They’re giving out chocolate cake. 
CHARLIE
PETER
Not to everyone.
Yes they are. It’s a party.
CHARLIE
I don’t know anyone.
PETER
Nobody does. Just walk over, stand 
there, and they’ll give you one.
Peter starts walking off, still facing Charlie:
PETER
You should hurry, they’re gonna run 
out, I’ll be right back! Hurry!
Peter rushes over to Bridget as she OPENS the door to the 
other room. Charlie looks nervously to the kitchen.
INT. OTHER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
38
38
Two BOYS - one Hispanic and one blonde - are in the room, 
watching videos on a tablet. Bridget enters, addressing them:
BRIDGET
Hey guys, Peter has weed.
The boys turn to Peter. Peter immediately deflates.
HISPANIC BOY (O.S.)
Sativa or indica?
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
39
39
Charlie steps into the doorway. Extremely shy. Her eyes are 
magnetized to the CHOCOLATE CAKE as the girls continue 
handing out slices.
36.
One GIRL notices Charlie’s fixed eyes. She warmly offers 
Charlie a slice. Charlie accepts without looking her in the 
eye.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
Charlie turns, digging into the cake. (Nuts are visibly a key 
ingredient.)
INT. OTHER ROOM - SAME TIME
40
40
Peter sits on the bed, beside Bridget. He packs marijuana 
into the bowl of a large bong.
BRIDGET
That was your sister, right?
PETER
Yeah. Charlie.
Peter’s cell phone VIBRATES.
HISPANIC BOY
(to Peter)
Is your sister hot?
Peter checks the cell. It’s ANNIE calling. Tense, he tucks 
the phone back into his pocket.
BRIDGET
I actually saw her drawing me last 
week.
PETER
Oh yeah?
BRIDGET
Yeah, she made me look crazy.
PETER
That’s Charlie.
Peter’s phone VIBRATES again. A yellow “Message Waiting” 
light blinks. Annie has left a VOICEMAIL.
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
41
41
Charlie walks around, holding an empty plate, her lips 
covered in chocolate. She stops for a moment to SWALLOW. She 
pauses, then swallows again. She looks slightly concerned.
37.
Charlie goes to a stack of RED CUPS and pulls one.
She goes to the kitchen faucet and draws herself a cup of 
water.
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
42
42
Annie is working on the miniature of the Graham house. She 
plants a freshly-painted FIGURINE of a ghostly old woman in a 
bathrobe (clearly Annie’s MOTHER) in the upstairs hall. The 
figurine looms outside the open door of the master bedroom 
replica, where figurines of Annie and Steve are asleep in 
bed.
INT. PARTY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
43
43
The party is still in full swing.
Charlie has found her way onto the COUCH and is now 
assembling a small manikin from disparate parts (from her 
pocket). Her cheeks look pink and slightly INFLAMED. An 
allergic reaction to the cake? It looks like she’s on the 
verge of throwing up, but she keeps her concentration on the 
manikin.
A concerned BOY (16) approaches Charlie. Not recognizing that 
she’s a girl:
CONCERNED BOY (O.S.)
Hey dude, you okay? You want some 
water?
Charlie doesn’t even look up.
CHARLIE
I’m okay.
CONCERNED BOY
You sure?
CHARLIE
Mm-hmm.
The Boy hesitantly walks off.
Charlie does NOT look good.
INT. OTHER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
44
44
Peter is drawing an impressive bong hit.
38.
The door is OPENED by Charlie.
CHARLIE
Peter?
This is just as Peter finishes inhaling. He COUGHS up smoke.
PETER
(like a chimney)
Charlie!
Peter immediately hides the bong behind his legs and looks to 
Charlie, affecting casualness.
PETER
(still spouting smoke)
What’s up?
Charlie looks scared.
PETER
Are you okay?
CHARLIE
It’s hard to breathe.
Charlie’s voice is cracked and strange.
PETER
What do you mean?
CHARLIE
(tearing up)
My tongue is getting bigger.
HARD CUT TO:
EXT. CAR - NIGHT
45
45
A distraught Peter pulls Charlie to the car. Charlie’s eyes 
bulge and her face is pitch-red. She seems UNABLE TO BREATHE.
Peter desperately opens the back door, guides Charlie in, 
slams the door, and runs to the driver side of the car.
INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
46
46
Peter speeds down the empty HIGHWAY. In the back seat, 
Charlie GASPS and gurgles for breath. She KICKS at the door 
and GRASPS at her throat. Tears of pain stream down her face.
Peter ACCELERATES. Speeding from 60 MPH to 65.
39.
PETER
You’re okay, Charlie! We’re going 
to the hospital!
Charlie frantically rolls down her window. Desperate for air.
Peter continues accelerating. 70 MPH.
Charlie forces her head through the BACK PASSENGER WINDOW.
She GASPS for breath, but her throat is swollen shut. She 
can’t even scream.
Peter continues accelerating. 75 MPH.
Charlie sticks her squealing head even farther out the 
window.
Peter continues accelerating. 80... 85... But THEN--
A grisly DEER CARCASS, smeared across the road, appears in 
the car’s headlights.
Peter SWERVES out of the way.
CHARLIE’S HEAD, flailing out of the window, COLLIDES FACE-
FIRST WITH A TELEPHONE POLE. The impact is so great that 
Charlie’s head is RIPPED OFF its shoulders.
The decapitated head SAILS silently in the car’s wake.
Peter STOMPS on the brakes. The car SQUEALS to an ear-
splitting halt.
The frozen car chugs quietly. Suspended in time.
Peter sits motionless. Paralyzed. His eyes are fixed on the 
road in front of him.
In the SIDE-VEW MIRROR, the dead deer (thirty feet back) is 
faintly visible in the car’s brake lights. Bathed in red.
Peter doesn’t dare look back. His foot is jammed into the 
brake.
In the back seat, Charlie sits headless. A torso.
Peter’s EYES begin to stray toward the REAR-VIEW MIRROR, but 
they STOP before they get there. Peter can’t look.
Peter reaches for the rear-view mirror and subtly turns it 
AWAY.
40.
The “Voicemail Waiting” light (from Peter’s cell) blinks 
through the fabric of his jeans pocket.
A long moment of silence, and then...
Peter’s foot slowly eases OFF the brake pedal.
The car begins to slowly idle forward.
Peter, eyes locked on the road ahead, allows the car to 
slowly pick up speed. His demeanor suggests that he’s in 
great denial. As if he’s saying to himself “it’s okay, 
nothing happened.”
The car drives onward. The headless torso rattles gently in 
the back seat.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
47
47
The car idles quietly into the driveway. It PARKS beside the 
other family car, but the engine continues humming.
The driver door opens, setting off the dull DING-DING-DING of 
the “door open/engine on” alarm. After a long pause, the 
engine is turned off. Peter steps out, as if in a dream 
state.
He walks stiffly away from the car and into the house.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
48
48
Peter stalks woodenly through the hall. He walks into his 
bedroom, leaving Annie and Steve to their sleep.
Peter climbs into bed, his door left open.
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
49
49
The next morning.
CLOSE-UP on Peter’s face, turned halfway into his pillow. His 
eyes are wide open.
Downstairs, we hear Annie pulling on her coat.
ANNIE (V.O.)
I’m running out for some balsa 
wood. You want anything?
STEVE (V.O.)
I’m good, baby. Drive safe.
41.
ANNIE (V.O.)
Okay! Back in twenty!
The front door is heard opening and shutting. We then hear: 
Annie walking to the car... The car door opening... Annie 
beginning to climb in. And then... Silence. Followed by... A 
horrible SCREAM, shrill and almost inhuman-sounding, issues 
from outside. Peter’s eyes WIDEN.
Annie is heard staggering backwards and falling down, 
muttering (almost inaudibly) “No, no, no, no...” Downstairs 
(in the house) Steve is heard reacting and running to the 
front door. Before he makes it outside, Annie lets out 
another blood-curdling SHRIEK, which prompts a HARD CUT TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
50
50
CHARLIE’S HEAD rests by the side of the road. The nose is 
completely smashed in. One eye is pitch red and the other is 
milky and opaque. The head is completely covered in ANTS.
The halted shriek (from the last shot) ECHOES OFF into the 
wretched silence of this shot.
The sound of THUNDER bridges our cut to:
INT. GRAHAM HALLWAY - NIGHT
51
51
A STORM rages outside.
Annie and Steve’s bedroom door is cracked open. We barely see 
ANNIE lying in bed, WEEPING and MOANING. Steve, sitting on 
the bed, consoles her. He tries to feed her a pill.
ANNIE
NO! I can't! I can't! I just wanna 
die!... I can't.
Steve rubs her head as she sinks into a more placid despair.
ANNIE
...It hurts too much. I just need 
to die.
And then more feelings come SURGING up. She MOANS an 
anguished moan.
We reveal PETER, standing paralyzed on the stairs, LISTENING.
His mother’s cries shred at his nerves.
ANNIE (O.S.)
42.
CHARLIE!!!
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
52
52
An overcast day. A sad gathering of mourners. Annie, Peter 
and Steve stand lost among them.
We are at a distance. The COFFIN (in profile) is being 
lowered into the ground. We are booming down to FOLLOW the 
sinking casket (keeping it centered), and as the coffin 
descends into the earth, so do we. We slowly creep down, 
losing sight of the cemetery and the mourners. We continue 
tracking down along the DIRT and the EARTHWORMS and the 
WEEDS, sinking deeper and deeper into the dark, wet soil.
Soon we are swallowed up again in BLACK.
INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
53
53
THE WAKE. Everything seems slightly opaque, as if seen 
through glass. Glossed over by grief.
People stand uneasily and talk in hushed tones.
STEVE stands in a daze, politely (but absently) accepting 
condolences.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
54
54
Annie lies in bed, facing the wall. Her back is to us.
INT. LIBRARY - SAME TIME
55
55
Peter stands (hiding?) in the family library, anxiously 
massaging his CELL PHONE with his thumb. He looks completely 
battered by trauma and self-loathing.
He observes the wake in the adjacent living room through the 
distortion of the library’s textured glass door. He watches 
Steve shake someone’s hand.
A MAN (40s) steps into the library, not expecting to find 
Peter.
MAN
(surprised)
Peter. How are you?
Peter smiles politely, but can’t answer. His eyes look almost 
deranged.
43.
MAN
Can I get you anything?
PETER
I’m just gonna use the bathroom.
MAN
Okay.
As Peter walks stiffly past, smiling his forced smile, the 
Man awkwardly adds:
MAN
I’m so sorry for your loss.
PETER
(exiting)
Thank you.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
56
56
Peter hastily enters the bathroom and LOCKS the door.
He stands frozen for a moment, battling panic. The sounds of 
the wake persist in the other room.
Peter turns on the SINK to create white noise.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
57
57
The remaining mourners are slowly filtering out. Steve 
politely ushers them, thanking them for coming.
Soon, everyone’s gone. Steve just stands there, in the middle 
of the room. Lost.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
58
58
Steve goes to the bathroom door. Tries to open it. It’s 
LOCKED. The running sink is faintly heard.
Steve pauses, then knocks gently.
STEVE
Peter?
No answer.
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME
59

44.
Peter sits on the edge of the tub. The sink is still running.
He holds his cell to his ear, listening to VOICEMAIL.

INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
60
60
Steve approaches his bedroom, but STOPS at the open door.
Annie is no longer in bed. The sheets have been dragged 
halfway off the mattress (presumably by Annie’s feet when she 
left).
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
61
61
Charlie’s lonely bedroom. Everything is as it was.
The door OPENS. It’s Steve. He stands at the door, taking the 
room in. After a moment, he steps inside.
MOMENTS LATER
Steve sits on Charlie’s bed. He has pulled up Charlie’s 
DRAWING PAD.
Steve opens the pad. He flips slowly through the pages. He 
takes care to really look at the drawings. As if appreciating 
them for the first time.
Steve passes several drawings of severed animal heads 
(including those of the rabbit, the rat and the cat, which we 
saw in Charlie’s shoebox). Steve then comes to Charlie’s 
half-finished drawing of the pigeon head (which now dons a 
CROWN).
45.
Steve studies it, and then turns the page to discover...a 
BLANK PAGE. There are no more drawings.
The floodgates open. Steve WEEPS.
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
62
62
Charlie’s bedroom is EMPTY again. It’s snowing outside.
The door is open, and the hallway’s lights are off.
Framed by the doorway, Peter walks past, determinedly not 
looking into the room.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
63
63
Peter enters. Without changing out of his clothes, he climbs 
into bed. The ALARM CLOCK reads 10:10 PM.
He turns to his side and gazes out the WINDOW. The imposing 
TREEHOUSE looms just outside. He stares at it.
LATER
Peter rolls huffily from his stomach to his back, unable to 
sleep. He turns to the ALARM CLOCK. It now reads 1:32 AM.
A beat, and then Peter climbs out of bed, gathers his blanket 
and pillow, and leaves the room.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
64
64
Peter, wearing his parka and an Elmer Fudd hat, emerges from 
the back door of the house. He carries his blanket and pillow 
through the light snowfall, heading for the TREEHOUSE.
He notes Charlie’s SHOEBOX near the base of the tree (having 
been dropped from the treehouse?). Flies are audible inside.
Peter grips the tree’s climbing handles and scales the tree.
INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
65
65
Peter climbs in. He lays out his blanket and lies down, 
positioning his pillow under his head. Now situated, he 
begins to close his eyes, but before they can shut, he SENSES 
something behind him. He slowly look back to SEE: ANNIE IS 
SLEEPING IN THE CORNER, bundled up in blankets.
46.
Startled, Peter STAGGERS out of his blanket, GRABS his 
things, and rushes frantically out of the treehouse. In his 
haste, his foot SLIPS OFF one of the wet climbing handles. He 
falls to land HARD on his back.
In pain, Peter rises and limps back toward the house.
WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM THIS TO...
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
66
66
Peter sits in the back of class as a teacher drones on at the 
blackboard. The teacher’s voice is distant and vague, as if 
heard from UNDER WATER.
Peter’s EYES are busy with nagging, obsessive thoughts. They 
narrow upward to his right.
We flash briefly to an INSERT of the family car’s REAR VIEW 
MIRROR (from Peter’s POV) on the night of the accident. The 
mirror is in focus, but whatever’s in the BACK SEAT 
(Charlie’s headless body) is blurry and just out of the 
mirror’s view.
We return to the CLASS. Peter snaps out of his reverie to see 
BRIDGET looking at him. Their eyes briefly MEET before she 
quickly turns back to the teacher.
Peter’s eyes HARDEN.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE = DAY
67
67
Annie draws the MAIL out of the mailbox. Among the letters is 
a BROCHURE. It reads “Calling All Skeptics!” Below that: “A 
PUBLIC SEANCE to be conducted by famed spiritual medium, 
Suzanne Marlowe!”
Annie goes PALE at the sight of this. She looks around, 
suddenly paranoid - as if nervous that she’s being watched.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
68
68
Annie is at work, trying to make progress on the HOSPICE 
MINIATURE. Her eyes are numb. She looks exhausted. She turns 
in her swivel-chair to face the miniature of the GRAHAM 
HOUSE. She stares at it.
Off-screen, the front door is heard UNLOCKING. Annie looks in 
the direction of the noise.
47.
INT. FOYER - SAME TIME
69
69
The front door opens and Steve enters.
STEVE
Annie?!
Max runs up to greet Steve, his tail wagging excitedly.
INT. WORKSHOP - SAME TIME
70
70
Annie goes to the door. Steve is heard scaling the stairs.
Before he can reach the top, Annie silently eases the door 
shut.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
71
71
The workshop door quietly CLOSES just before Steve appears at 
the top of the stairs. He approaches the workshop.
He knocks on the door.
No answer.
He eases the door open. Annie “works” with her back to the 
door. She’s now wearing HEADPHONES, “listening” to classical 
music.
Steve smiles sadly and closes the door, leaving Annie to her 
work.
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
72
72
Steve enters the kitchen. Mail waits on the kitchen island.
He finds the BROCHURE for the public seance, and DUMPS it in 
the trash.
In the b.g., Annie CROSSES the doorway. Steve doesn’t see.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
73
73
Annie sits in the blue family car, parked in the driveway.
(The green car - the “accident” car - is now permanently 
gone.) Annie is trying to work up the nerve to start the 
engine. Then, in the SIDE-VIEW MIRROR, she sees: Peter rides 
his BICYCLE up the driveway. He arrives at the front porch, 
but stays on the bike. He doesn’t see Annie.
48.
Annie has TENSED UP. She sits motionless for fear of being 
seen, eyes LOCKED on Peter. He stands for a long time at the 
front door, preparing to face his family.
Annie watches as Peter continues to gather himself. He 
finally takes a decisive breath, gets off the bike, and 
quietly enters the house.
Annie remains tense. She turns on the car’s IGNITION.
EXT. CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - EVENING
74
74
Annie idles into the parking lot of the HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM 
(from earlier). Outside, the same SUPPORT GROUP is gathering.
Annie pulls into a spot. Turns off the ignition. She stares 
at the gymnasium door. Watches tensely as people solemnly 
enter. She doesn’t move.
After a long internal debate, Annie finally STARTS the car 
back up, and begins to drive off. As she approaches the exit, 
an OLDER WOMAN (late 60s) runs suddenly - and merrily - into 
the HEADLIGHTS, flagging Annie down. Annie BRAKES.
The woman circles over to Annie’s window. Annie hesitantly 
rolls it down.
OLDER WOMAN
Hi! Hello. Sorry to chase you down.
(awkwardly)
Were you not coming in?
ANNIE
(cornered)
I, no, I just - forgot something.
OLDER WOMAN
Okay, sorry, I just - I recognized 
you from a few months ago. You were 
here because your mother?
ANNIE
Oh...
OLDER WOMAN
I feel crazy now. Sorry! I’m Joan.
ANNIE
(feeling trapped)
Hi.
JOAN
Are you doing any better?
49.
ANNIE
What?
JOAN
With your mother...?
ANNIE
(still confused)
What?
(and then)
No. That’s not... My daughter was 
killed.
JOAN
Oh. My God. I’m so, so sorry.
Brief, heavy silence. Joan stammeringly offers:
JOAN
Would you like to come in with me? 
Or we can even just get a coffee. 
There’s a place down the street.
ANNIE
I’m sorry. Really. Thank you.
(gesturing to leave)
I really did forget something.
Joan bluntly offers:
OLDER WOMAN
My son died.
ANNIE
Oh...! I’m so sorry.
Joan smiles tightly, heartbroken.
JOAN
How old was yours?
Annie looks like she’s being held hostage.
ANNIE
(pained to say it)
Fourteen.
JOAN
Oh God, that’s awful!
(matter of fact)
My son and my grandson drowned. 
Four months ago. The little one was 
seven.
50.
ANNIE
(horrified)
Oh my God.
JOAN
I’ve been coming here for a month 
now and it has helped. I just 
wanted to say. It has. It doesn’t 
make it easier - obviously. But 
sometimes it just, makes it less 
lonely.
ANNIE
(awkwardly)
Okay...
JOAN
And I’m gonna embarrass myself now, 
but if you ever need someone to 
talk to...
Joan writes her PHONE NUMBER onto a piece of paper.
JOAN
’Cause we all do.
She hands Annie the phone number.
JOAN
Just if you need it.
ANNIE
Okay. Thank you. Really.
Annie is moved, despite her discomfort. Joan walks off, 
giving Annie a warm little wave.
INT. FOYER - NIGHT
75
75
Annie lumbers in. She pulls off her snow boots.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
76
76
Steve is asleep in an armchair, bathed in the dim glow of the 
muted TV. Annie appears in the doorway.
ANNIE
Hey.
STEVE
(waking up)
Oh! Hey.
51.
ANNIE
I’m going to bed.
STEVE
Where were you?
ANNIE
At the movies. I’m going to bed.
STEVE
I’ll come with you.
ANNIE
(put off)
...Okay.
Annie leaves the doorway.
STEVE
And can you please let me know when 
you’re going to the movies? I was 
worried.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
77
77
Annie and Steve are in bed. Annie’s back is to Steve. Neither 
is asleep.
Steve gently SNUGGLES UP to Annie, but she is like stone. He 
self-consciously touches her hip. She recoils.
Steve backs off. There is a long moment of tension, and then 
Annie RISES from bed.
ANNIE
I’m gonna be right back.
She gathers a blanket, which is bundled on the room’s 
armchair.
STEVE
You’re not coming right back. 
You’re taking the blanket.
ANNIE
I can’t sleep.
STEVE
Annie: it’s freezing outside.
ANNIE
The heater’s up there.
52.
Steve wants to fight this, but Annie is clearly anxious to 
avoid a conversation.
STEVE
...Okay.
ANNIE
Is that okay?
STEVE
(”what am I supposed to 
say?”)
Yeah. Fine. Come back if you get 
cold.
ANNIE
I just need to sleep.
Annie leaves.
INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT
78
78
We push in on an ominous WIDE of Annie lying asleep in 
Charlie’s treehouse. Two LARGE HEATERS have been set up on 
either side of her. They burn a BRIGHT ORANGE.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
79
79
Peter lies in bed, awake. Outside his window, Charlie’s 
treehouse emits an orange glow.
A CLICKING SOUND (like Charlie’s tongue-clicking) is suddenly 
heard in the room. Peter FREEZES, now listening for it. After 
a moment, there’s another CLICK.
Peter BOLTS up in bed. His eyes frenziedly scan the room. He 
fixes on a DARK CORNER. A HOODIE SWEATSHIRT hangs on the 
wall, and for a brief moment, it looks almost like a standing 
person.
Peter continues listening intently for another click... 
Silence. It has stopped.
INT. WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY
80
80
Outside, a beautiful day.
53.
Inside, Annie is hard at work. Her eyes are intense - furious 
even - as she carefully works on the replica of Charlie’s 
bedroom. She scratches a tiny replica of the word-carving she 
saw earlier (”Satony”) into the wall behind the bed. As she 
does this, her attention is drawn to a looming POST-IT NOTE, 
which reads:
Call gallery about extending?
Annie disregards this. She goes for a new bottle of paint, 
but as she reaches, an open paint bottle is KNOCKED over.
ANNIE
Shit.
It tipped over near Annie’s extending hand, but it didn’t 
look like Annie actually touched it.
Annie grabs paper towels and quickly mops up the mess. She 
pulls a few drenched items out of the widening paint puddle.
Among them: JOAN’S PHONE NUMBER. She looks at it.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
81
81
Peter walks absent-mindedly down the hall. THREE STONER BOYS 
(including Brendan) are walking toward him, huddled and 
giggling. They notice Peter.
BRENDAN
Yo, Pete.
PETER
Hey.
BRENDAN
(whispering)
You wanna join us for a walk?
On “walk,” he mimes pinching a joint with his thumb and 
forefinger.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER FIELD - DAY
82
82
Peter sits under the BLEACHERS with the three stoners. They 
pass around a PIPE packed with weed. Brendan takes a hit.
BRENDAN
(looking at his phone)
Am I the only one who’s Facebook 
friends with Becky?
54.
Brendan passes the pipe to Peter.
STONER #2
You’re friends with Becky?
Peter holds the pipe. Stares at it.
STONER #3
Facebook friends, bitch!
(back to his point)
Oh my God, her statuses...
BRENDAN
Oh my God, dude, I know.
BRENDAN
Every ten seconds!
Peter LIGHTS the bowl and takes a reluctant hit.
BRENDAN
“I’m going to the bathroom now.” 
5:45. “Just got back from the 
bathroom!” 5:46.
Peter COUGHS OUT a lungful of pot smoke. He immediately looks 
regretful.
BRENDAN
What about Brian with his 
girlfriend?
Stoner #2 nods his head, choking on laughter. Peter’s eyes 
are wide with a burgeoning panic. He does not look well.
STONER #2
Ha! His “princess”?!
STONER #2 (O.S.)
“Going to pick up my princess from 
the airport!” “Eating cous-cous 
with my princess!”
Peter looks like he’s starting to have an ATTACK. The Stoners 
are oblivious.
STONER #3
Who’s his girlfriend?
STONER #2
Some fuckin’ stupid college chick.
STONER #3
55.
What the fuck?! I want some stupid 
college princess chick.
Stoner #2 notices that Peter is freaking out.
STONER #2
Dude. Are you okay?
PETER
I feel like I can’t breathe.
STONER #2
What?
PETER
I feel like I’m having a reaction.
PETER
No, man, don’t freak out. You just 
smoked too much.
BRENDAN
No, I think I need a doctor. My 
tongue is getting bigger.
Peter is crying now.
STONER #2
Should we take you to the nurse??
PETER
(scared)
I dunno.
BRENDAN
Look, dude: you’re breathing. See? 
You’re just really high.
Peter is trying to calm down.
BRENDAN
See? You’re okay. You just got too 
high.
(rubbing his back)
You’re okay, dude. You’re 
breathing.
Stoner #2 and Stoner #3 exchange “holy shit” looks.
EXT. STREET - DAY
83
83
56.
Annie walks down an urban street, looking for an address. She 
pinches the paper with Joan’s number. On its other side is an 
ADDRESS in Annie’s handwriting.
Annie finds the address. A large, red-brick APARTMENT 
BUILDING.
INT. APARMENT BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
84
84
The elevator opens, depositing Annie onto the THIRD FLOOR.
Annie proceeds down the well-lit hall, arriving at APARTMENT 
316. She knocks.
While waiting, Annie looks down. She’s standing on a HAND-
MADE WELCOME MAT. The word “JOANIE” has been embroidered into 
it.
After a moment, the door is opened by JOAN.
JOAN
Annie! You came!
ANNIE
It’s a little earlier than we said.
ANNIE
Ah, you’re perfect. Come in.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
85
85
Annie follows Joan in. Joan closes the door behind them. The 
apartment is cheerfully decorated in bright, homey colors.
Joan rushes off to the KITCHEN, where a TEA KETTLE is 
whistling. Annie stays by the door.
ANNIE
Your welcome mat...
JOAN
Oh - it’s cute, right?
Joan pulls the kettle off the stove and pours two cups.
ANNIE
My mother used to embroider ones 
just like that.
JOAN
Oh really? How funny!
57.
Joan sets the tea on the KITCHEN table.
JOAN
Please. Sit.
MINUTES LATER
Joan and Annie sit at the table, nursing their tea. The 
conversation has become very heavy, and the spotlight is 
currently on a very fragile Annie. She speaks steadily, in 
fragments, as if to hold herself together. Her eyes are fixed 
on the floor.
ANNIE
He left her in the back seat. Went 
straight to bed.
Joan nods sympathetically. Her eyes locked attentively on 
Annie.
ANNIE
And then I wake up. Went to my 
workshop. Needed some supplies. I 
go down to the car. Step inside. 
First the smell of something wrong. 
Then the - body. Slumped. Covered 
in black, blood, like tar...
(fighting tears)
And her head wasn’t there, so I 
couldn’t see her face. But they 
were her clothes. And her hands... 
her fingernails...
Joan is pale as she listens. Annie is trembling, locked on 
the memory.
Joan gently lays her hand over Annie’s. Beat.
JOAN
When they dragged up my son and 
grandson, they needed me to 
identify the bodies. But they 
didn’t warn me what bodies look 
like after they’ve been in the 
ocean. You can probably imagine - 
they swell up, get distended, turn 
grey. I didn’t know that. My son’s 
eyes were eaten out of his head by 
fish. And my grandson’s face - like 
a balloon.
Annie is looking up at Joan now. They share in this. The 
grisly details are somehow (in their morbid way) comforting.
58.
Breaking the spell, Annie pulls a PILL from her purse. She 
downs it with a gulp of TEA. She catches something on her 
tongue, and pulls a BLACK HERB from her mouth. She pays it no 
mind.
JOAN
I can sometimes swear I feel them 
in the room... Do you ever have 
that?
ANNIE
...Small moments maybe.
This hangs for a moment.
JOAN
How’s your relationship with your 
son?
ANNIE
...Peter?
Joan brightens: “That’s his name?” Annie thinks about Joan’s 
question.
ANNIE
Oh God...
Her face DARKENS and she chuckles. She brushes it off, but 
then PAUSES. She decides to actually answer.
ANNIE
I sleepwalk.
(pause)
I haven't in a long time, but two 
years ago I woke up - and I really 
don’t remember this because I was 
asleep - but I woke up standing 
next to Peter and Charlie’s bed
(when they shared a room)
, and they were completely covered 
in paint thinner... And so was I. 
From head to toe... And I was 
standing there, and I was holding a 
box of matches. And I woke myself 
up by striking one. Which also woke 
up Peter. And he started screaming. 
And I immediately put out the 
match, immediately, but my husband 
came in... and I was just as 
shocked as he was, but I was the 
one with the matches.
59.
Joan is listening with no judgment. Annie, frustrated by the 
memory, takes a deep breath.
ANNIE
And it was impossible to convince 
them that it was just sleepwalking 
- which of course it was - but the 
timing was awful, Peter and I had 
already fallen into this stupid 
quarrelling phase - arguing forever 
about nothing - such frivolous 
things - but that’s when the 
incident happened, so...!
(throws her hands up)
Over time, everyone affected 
casualness, “moving on.” But they 
never forgot and Peter’s always 
held it against me and there's 
nothing I can say and there’s 
nothing I can do because it 
happened. While I was asleep.
JOAN
Did your daughter hold it against 
you?
ANNIE
Oh, she was off in the clouds 
somewhere. Probably didn’t even 
notice.
Beat.
JOAN
(empathic)
It’s impossible being a mother.
Annie looks at Joan. “Yes it is.”
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
86
86
Steve is chopping carrots at the kitchen island. Peter is 
heard ENTERING in the foyer.
STEVE
Hey, that was fast. Did you bike 
all the way here?
PETER
(voice cracked)
My friend dropped me.
STEVE
60.
Oh - you should’ve invited him in.
But Peter’s already going for the stairs. Steve tries to 
catch up with him.
STEVE
Did you remember to sign up for 
that SAT prep course?
Peter has made it to the top of stairs. Hiding his wrought 
face:
PETER
I will tomorrow.
STEVE
You need to, Peter! That’s coming 
up!
INT. PETER’S ROOM - DAY
87
87
Peter lies in bed, on his side. He looks ready to burst back 
into tears.
Steve knocks on the door. Pokes his head in.
STEVE
Peter?
Peter turns to him, stifling tears.
STEVE
Are you okay?
PETER
(deflecting)
Are you?
Pause.
STEVE
Is there anything we can talk 
about, Peter?
PETER
Like what?
STEVE
Like anything. What’s going on? 
What are you feeling?
PETER
What are you feeling?
61.
STEVE
I’m worried about you.
Peter stares at Steve, eyes wide. Unable to communicate.
STEVE
(careful)
It doesn’t have to be with me, 
either. Maybe you’d like to talk 
with somebody else...
PETER
About what?
STEVE
About everything. You’re going 
through a lot, Peter.
PETER
So are you!
STEVE
Well - we all are. I think we could 
all use someone to talk to.
PETER
So why aren’t you, then?
STEVE
I probably will. I probably need 
to.
A long, fraught pause.
STEVE
You don’t have to choose now. I’m 
just letting you know that it’s 
there.
STEVE
You could even see one of the guys 
in my building. I know a few guys.
PETER
(warming up to it?)
...And you think I need to go?
STEVE
(briefest pause)
Well, that’s for you to say. I 
can’t tell you your experience.
Peter suddenly deflates . Not the answer he needed. He chills 
over.
62.
PETER
Maybe later.
STEVE
...Okay. Let me know.
PETER
Okay.
Steve nods for a long time. Trying to think of anything else.
STEVE
All right. Dinner in a bit.
Steve smiles sensitively. Too sensitive. He leaves.
INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT
88
88
Annie is at work. Behind her, the door opens and Steve 
enters. He approaches to see...
Annie is working on a new piece: a NEW MINIATURE of the 
HIGHWAY of Charlie’s accident, including the TELEPHONE POLE 
that took her head. This also features a tiny figurine of 
Charlie’s decapitated head and a figurine of Peter in the 
family car.
STEVE
Oh Jesus... Are you planning on 
letting him see that?
ANNIE
Who?
STEVE
(strong pause)
How do you think Peter’s gonna feel 
about that?
ANNIE
What? It’s not about him.
STEVE
Oh no?
ANNIE
...It’s an objective view of the 
accident!
Steve just eyes her.
ANNIE
Okay, so what is it, then?
63.
STEVE
ANNIE
It’s cruel, Annie. And 
unforgiving...
Oh my God!
STEVE
And useless.
ANNIE
(incredulous)
What do you think I’m trying to say 
with this?! You think I’d ever want 
to hurt my own son?! Are you 
crazy?!
Steve almost responds, but bites his tongue.
ANNIE
Oh Jesus you’re sanctimonious. I 
get it: you’re a good father, 
you’re a good husband - get off the 
stage.
Steve boils.
STEVE
(through clenched teeth)
Are you coming to dinner?
ANNIE
I’m making dinner!
STEVE
(snapping)
I made dinner! I’m GETTING you for 
dinner!
(storms away)
Come down or stay here, I don’t 
give a shit.
On “give”, he SLAMS the door behind him.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
89
89
Annie, Steve and Peter sit at the dinner table. A fourth 
chair divides Annie and Peter. Annie is fuming from her last 
interaction with Steve. Beside her glass: an unswallowed 
pill.
PETER
64.
This is really good, dad.
Annie balks to herself. Peter tenses.
STEVE
Thanks buddy.
Annie mouths the word “buddy” to herself, incredulous. Peter 
catches this.
PETER
(with an edge)
You okay, mom?
Annie turns to Peter.
ANNIE
What?
PETER
Is there something on your mind?
Annie can’t believe this.
ANNIE
Is there something on your mind?
PETER
It just looks like you might want 
to say something.
STEVE
(stepping in)
Peter...
ANNIE
Like what? Why would I want to say 
something? So I can watch you can 
roll your eyes at me?
PETER
I have never rolled my eyes to. You 
get the point across.
ANNIE
Oh sweetie - you don’t have at you.
PETER
(suddenly defiant)
Okay. So say what you wanna say, 
then.
STEVE
Peter--
65.
ANNIE
(getting angry)
I don’t want to say anything. I’ve 
tried saying things.
PETER
So try again. Release yourself.
ANNIE
Release you, you mean!
PETER
So fine, so release me! What do you 
wanna say? Fuckin’ say it!
Annie explodes out of her seat.
ANNIE
Don't you swear at me - you little 
shit! You don’t EVER raise your 
voice at me! I'm your Mother, you 
understand? I've given everything 
to you! All I ever DO is worry and 
slave and defend you, and all I get 
back is that fucking face on your 
face! So full of disdain and 
resentment and always so annoyed. 
Well, now your sister’s dead! And I 
know you miss her and I know it was 
an “accident” and I know you're in 
pain - and I wish I could take it 
all away! I wish I could shield you 
from the knowledge that you did 
what you did - but your sister is 
dead. She's gone forever. And what 
a waste. If it could’ve maybe 
brought us together - something! - 
if you could have just said “I’m 
sorry” or faced up to what 
happened: maybe then we could do 
something with this! But you can’t 
take responsibility for anything, 
so now I can’t accept. And I can’t 
forgive. Because nobody admits what 
they’ve done!
She sits down. A heavy silence.
Peter is looking away, fighting tears. But then, after a long 
silence...
PETER
And what about you, mom?
(long pause, then)
66.
I didn’t want to take her...and she 
didn’t want to go... So why was she 
there?
Annie looks at him. Incredulous. She is boiling with rage, 
but...this has also hit her somewhere deep. She’s desperately 
avoided facing this question since the accident.
STEVE
Okay, we’re stopping this.
He looks at Annie, who looks like she’s about to lose her 
mind.
STEVE
We’re stopping this right now.
Annie glowers at him. Adversarial. She finally relents.
ANNIE
Fine.
She tensely RISES hesitates, but then hesitates, about to say 
something else. But then:
ANNIE
Fine.
She leaves.
Steve turns to Peter: he’s doing everything in his power to 
keep from exploding into tears. Steve looks powerless to 
help.
INT. ANNIE AND STEVE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
90
90
Steve enters the bedroom, furious. Annie is sitting on the 
bed, a hardness in her eyes.
STEVE
What the hell are you doing?
ANNIE
What am I doing?!
STEVE
Try to stop and see what’s 
happening, Annie. For one second. 
Try to see where this could go. 
It’s not the right choice.
ANNIE
67.
These are your choices, too! You 
choose to not see how he is. How 
cold he is with me. How dimissive.
STEVE
So we’ll deal with that! We can go 
to family therapy, whatever - but 
don’t make it about Charlie!
ANNIE
Oh, family therapy! Right!
ANNIE
So what, then? We just chalk it up 
to an act of God?
STEVE
(strongly)
Yes.
ANNIE
He just left her in the car! Went 
straight to bed! Not a word!
STEVE
You can’t even imagine he was in 
shock?
ANNIE
He left us to be in shock, too!
STEVE
There was no way around that. You 
need to stop this. If he had warned 
us, we still would have run out 
there to find her in the same way.
ANNIE
(ignoring him)
And it wasn’t a fucking BBQ either. 
He lied to us, through his teeth. 
He took her to some sleazy high 
school house party!
STEVE
You knew it wasn’t a BBQ!
ANNIE
He just left her head in the road 
and kept driving. He went to sleep!
STEVE
Goddamn it -- He was in shock. He’s 
still in shock.
68.
ANNIE
(acidly)
He looks pretty gathered to me.
STEVE
Gathered?!
ANNIE
You’re holding yourself together 
awfully well, too!
STEVE
Excuse me? And what the hell does 
that mean?
(no answer)
Someone has to keep things from 
unraveling completely, Annie.
ANNIE
(exploding)
It HAS unraveled completely!
Silence. Steve is frozen.
ANNIE
...Don’t worry. I blame myself, 
too.
STEVE
That’s worthless.
ANNIE
I’m the one who made her go to the 
party.
STEVE
Oh, stop it!
ANNIE
No! Don’t you dare! He’s right! I 
made Peter take her! She begged me 
not to go!
STEVE
I was happy she was going! Be 
around other kids instead of that 
fuckin’ treehouse for a change! I 
would have pushed her if you 
hadn't!
ANNIE
But you didn’t push her. I did.
STEVE
69.
...We have no control over 
anything, Annie. The ceiling could 
collapse on us right now and who 
would we blame?
Brief pause.
ANNIE
You don’t understand anything, do 
you?
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
91
91
Peter boils in bed, staring out the window.
A gentle knock at the door. It cracks open and Steve sticks 
his head in.
STEVE
Goodnight, Petey.
Peter looks at Steve.
PETER
Do you blame me, too?
STEVE
Goddamn it -
Steve opens the door all the way.
STEVE
- of course not. No one blames you.
Steve approaches Peter.
STEVE
I don’t for one second imagine that 
you’re not going through the exact 
same thing we are.
PETER
Mom doesn’t think so.
STEVE
Stop it with mom. She’s blaming 
everyone. It’s part of grieving. 
She blames herself.
Peter has started to cry.
PETER
She wasn’t driving the car.
70.
STEVE
She could have. Anyone could have.
PETER
(through helpless tears)
I didn’t even care about her...! 
That’s how it happened...!
Steve is momentarily overwhelmed.
STEVE
(weakly)
You love your sister.
PETER
(boiling with self-
hatred)
I should be dead. At least she 
could draw. She made things. I 
don’t do anything.
STEVE
Yes you do. Don’t ever say that.
PETER
(burying his face in his 
pillow)
I’m nothing. I do nothing.
Steve, looking helpless, rests his hand on Peter’s head.
Peter WEEPS. Steve is also crying now.
PETER
(into his pillow)
I’m sorry!
STEVE
Shhh! I’m sorry.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
92
92
Annie lies on the bed, her back to us. We hear Peter’s 
weeping, muffled through the walls. We then hear:
ANNIE
(barely audible)
I’m sorry.
Annie’s back begins to rise and fall in a fit of sobs.
FADE TO BLACK
71.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY - DAYS LATER
93
93
CLOSE-UP of Annie’s face. Lethargic. She’s lost a few pounds 
since we last saw her, and is wearing an old T-shirt and 
pajama bottoms.
She stares at her unfinished miniatures. Her eyes then drift 
to a Post-It note above her desk. It reads “KEEP WORKING!”
INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY
94
94
Annie pushes a cart down an aisle of miniature building 
materials. She looks farther down the aisle, and suddenly 
STOPS, having noticed...
JOAN is pushing a cart toward Annie. She hasn’t yet noticed 
Annie. She wears an ECSTATIC SMILE as she giddily scans the 
chalk section.
Confused by Joan’s demeanor (and her presence), Annie warily 
begins to push her cart toward her.
ANNIE
Joan?
Joan looks up to see Annie.
JOAN
Oh my -- Annie?!
ANNIE
Hi...!
Joan circles the carts to give Annie a big, warm, very 
sustained HUG.
ANNIE
Are you okay?
JOAN
(beaming)
Oh Annie. Yes. I’m really good. I’m 
really really...
Annie nods, forcing a smile. She looks concerned for Joan’s 
sanity.
JOAN
Something happened, Annie. I feel 
completely - turned around.
ANNIE
What happened?
72.
JOAN
(laughing)
I don’t know if I should even say!
ANNIE
(laughing now, too)
What do you mean?
JOAN
You’re gonna think I’m crazy!
ANNIE
Not at all...!
JOAN
I... Oh God. I...
(confidentially)
...met a spiritual medium.
Annie affects a patronizing “Oh Wow” expression.
JOAN
(explaining)
They were performing an open seance 
-- and I know: I know what you’re 
thinking, but they asked me to 
attend. They were bringing in 
skeptics and scientists so they 
wouldn’t be accused of fraud. But I 
went, fully skeptical, and what I 
experienced there was truly...
Joan tries to think of a suitably ecstatic adjective.
ANNIE
An “open seance”?
JOAN
They brought back the spirit of a 
man from the 19th century! And not 
like as a smoke and mirrors thing. 
The man next to me was a deadly 
cynical neurologist, and he looked 
permanently changed by the end of 
it.
Annie makes another “wow” face.
JOAN
73.
And I do know what you’re thinking, 
Annie - of course - but I 
approached the medium and I asked 
her about my son and grandson, and 
she came to my apartment and she 
ended up performing a, uh - well - 
she...conjured my grandson!
Annie, still forcing a smile, now looks frightened.
JOAN
I know what you’re smiling at. I 
wouldn’t believe it myself. I 
didn’t! But I heard his voice, I 
felt him in the room. It’s real.
Annie’s warped smile is plastered appeasingly to her face.
JOAN
What are you doing right now?
ANNIE
I’m just - here, shopping.
JOAN
You wanna come over?
Annie doesn’t know what to say.
JOAN
I really think you should. Please. 
It would be everything if you came.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - DAY
95
95
The front door opens and Joan enters, followed uneasily by 
Annie. Joan smiles widely.
JOAN
Hello!
This “hello” was seemingly directed at the room in general.
Joan hustles to the KITCHEN. She takes SWEETGRASS and smears 
it across the surface of the kitchen table. Also on the table 
is an UPTURNED DRINKING GLASS.
JOAN
(to Annie)
This is part of it.
Annie is hovering outside the kitchen.
74.
JOAN
Come in. Come in.
Annie hesitantly enters. The WINDOW has been blacked out with 
duvateen.
JOAN
Okay: a few things. First: you 
shouldn’t do this without a medium 
unless you are a medium. That’s 
what she told me.
ANNIE
Okay.
JOAN
But I told you: I’d been 
experiencing these...sensations a 
long time before the medium. I just 
didn’t know how to explain them! So 
I tried this last night. This was 
after the medium was here.
ANNIE
What’s “this”?
JOAN
Sit down.
Annie is skeptical.
JOAN
Trust me.
Annie sits down.
JOAN
I’m turning off the light.
JOAN TURNS OFF THE LIGHTS.
JOAN
You okay?
ANNIE
...Yes.
Joan lights a BLACK CANDLE.
ANNIE
(forcing levity)
Nice mood setter.
JOAN
75.
Okay. Put your hand on the glass, 
but don’t add pressure.
Annie lays her hand on the overturned glass. Joan does the 
same.
JOAN
I won’t add pressure, either.
ANNIE
(more to herself)
What am I doing?
After a moment of silence, Joan speaks to the room.
JOAN
Louie?
Beat.
JOAN
Louie, are you here? It’s grandma.
A COLD DRAFT crosses the room. Annie gets a tingle. But the 
window is shut, as is the door.
JOAN
Louie, if you’re here with us, 
please just try to slide the glass.
(pause)
Louie, if you’re here--
The glass SLIDES, barely. Annie jumps, retracting her hand.
JOAN
(tears of happiness)
Hi Louie!
ANNIE
(eyes wide)
How did you do that?
Annie looks under the table. There’s nothing there.
JOAN
(continuing)
Louie, I’m gonna ask you some 
questions - okay, sweetie? If the 
answer’s yes, just slide the glass 
to the right. If it’s no, slide it 
this way -
(demonstrating)
- to the left. Do you understand?
76.
The glass SLIDES again, slightly to the right.
ANNIE
Oh my God.
JOAN
Louie, are you okay?
The glass slides right again.
JOAN
Are you in pain?
The glass slides to the left.
Annie is gripping her chair. She stares unblinkingly at the 
glass.
Suddenly ANNIE’S HAIR IS BRUSHED TO THE SIDE, as if by an 
invisible hand. She JUMPS. Joan calmly takes Annie’s hand.
JOAN
It’s okay.
ANNIE
(frightened)
What is?
Joan pulls up a small CHALKBOARD from below the table. It’s 
unmarked. A tiny piece of chalk rests on the surface.
JOAN
Louie, I brought your chalkboard. 
Remember your chalkboard?
The glass budges slightly to the right.
JOAN
Can you write something?
A long moment of inactivity, and THEN...
The piece of chalk MOVES (as if by invisible fingers) to 
scrawl the words “I LOV YU GRANMA” in a young child’s 
handwriting!
JOAN
Oh Louie, I love you, sweetheart!
Joan is crying tears of joy.
ANNIE
I’m sorry, can we stop?
77.
JOAN
What?
ANNIE
I’m sorry. Please.
JOAN
(to the room)
Louie, we’re gonna stop for a 
second, but I’m coming right back!
Joan jumps up and turns on the lights. Annie looks rattled.
JOAN
Are you okay?
ANNIE
(shaken)
I’m sorry, I’m really...
JOAN
I understand. That’s how I reacted 
at first.
ANNIE
I think I need to go.
JOAN
That’s okay.
ANNIE
Thank you. I’m sorry.
Annie RISES. Joan blows out the candle, grabs it, and 
shuffles to the kitchen to fetch a sheet of paper. It 
features a Sanskrit prayer transcribed in carefully 
handwritten English.
Joan returns to Annie with the paper and the black candle.
JOAN
Here:
(handing them to her)
If you wanna try this yourself, 
light the candle and choose one 
item that belonged to your daughter 
- that’ll be your link to her. Mine 
was the chalkboard. That’s my link. 
And then, when you’re ready -
(seriously, re: the 
paper)
- read this out loud - every 
syllable - very carefully.
78.
ANNIE
(overwhelmed)
Why? What is it?
JOAN
I don’t know what language it is. 
The medium had me read it, too. 
It’s to make it start. But your 
whole family - everyone needs to be 
in the room. Your son. Everyone.
Annie uneasily accepts the articles and then turns to leave.
As she walks toward the door:
JOAN
You didn’t kill her, Annie.
Annie turns sharply to Joan.
ANNIE
What?
JOAN
She isn’t gone.
ANNIE
I didn’t kill her!
Joan smiles warmly. “I know.”
ANNIE
Okay. Thank you.
Annie leaves, trembling.
INT. CAR - MOVING - EVENING
96
96
A discombobulated Annie drives back home. Her eyes are 
buzzing and her movements are jerky and ill-possessed.
She slows to a stop at a red light.
As she sits waiting for the light to change, Annie hears a 
CLICKING SOUND in the back seat. She goes white. She slowly 
turns to look at the empty back seat. The clicking has 
ceased.
Annie’s eyes are crazed.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
97
97
79.
A wide shot of the house. Bathed in the pale moonlight, it 
almost looks like one of Annie’s miniatures. All the lights 
are off, save for ONE window.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
98
98
Steve is fast asleep. Annie’s side of the bed is EMPTY.
The door to the MASTER BATHROOM is closed, but a band of 
light is visible beneath the door. Behind the door, Annie is 
heard WHISPERING intensely - presumably on the phone.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Can it be anything?... Like her 
clothes?
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
99
99
CLOSE UP on Peter’s profile. He’s asleep.
Off-screen, the door is heard CREAKING OPEN. After a moment, 
Annie leans into frame, hovering over Peter.
ANNIE
(whispering)
Peter.
Peter doesn’t stir.
ANNIE
Sweetheart. Peter. Wake up.
Peter inhales sharply. He wakes with a start.
PETER
What?
ANNIE
It’s okay, honey, it’s me.
Peter is still getting oriented. Annie looks strangely 
hopeful.
ANNIE
I’m so, so sorry for everything. 
Please, please forgive me. I can’t 
stand the things I said.
PETER
It’s okay.
Annie bends over to envelop him in a hug.
80.
ANNIE
Can you get up, sweetheart? We’re 
gonna try something.
PETER
I was just having a nightmare.
ANNIE
That’s okay, baby. We can do 
something.
PETER
Do what?
ANNIE
I’ve figured it out.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
100
100
Annie stands over Steve, who’s asleep in bed.
ANNIE
Steve. Baby.
She nudges him gently.
ANNIE
Steve. Wake up.
Steve jolts awake.
STEVE
What’s going on?
ANNIE
Come downstairs with us. We’re 
gonna do something together.
Steve looks to the door. Peter is standing nervously in the 
unlit hallway.
INT. STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER
101
101
Annie walks down the hall. Steve and Peter follow warily 
behind.
PETER
(whispering)
Dad?
STEVE
(whispering)
81.
It’s okay.
Annie leads them to the unlit DINING ROOM...
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
102
102
The oval dining table has been set with an upturned DRINKING 
GLASS. Beside it is CHARLIE’S DRAWING PAD and one of 
Charlie’s hoodies. The BLACK CANDLE that Joan gave Annie is 
dimly illuminating the table. The WINDOW is open, and it is 
COLD. Peter hugs himself; Steve rubs his arms.
STEVE
It’s freezing.
Steve goes for the window.
ANNIE
No: Don’t change anything. I don’t 
want to mess it up.
Annie sits down. There is a chair on either side of her.
ANNIE
Everyone sit.
They don’t.
ANNIE
My friend Joan taught me how to do 
this.
STEVE
What friend Joan? And what’s 
“this”?
ANNIE
Please sit. We need our palms on 
the table and our fingers to touch.
STEVE
What are we doing, Annie?
ANNIE
Please. You’ll see.
Steve just looks at her.
ANNIE
Please just trust me.
Steve doesn’t budge.
82.
ANNIE
Fine!
Annie stands up, DRAGS the table halfway towards Steve and 
Peter, and GRABS their hands.
ANNIE
We can do it here, then.
She SQUEEZES their hands.
ANNIE
I need you both to concentrate.
PETER
On what?
ANNIE
(pause)
Think about Charlie if you can.
STEVE
(stern)
Annie!
Steve pulls his hand away from Annie.
ANNIE
(urgent)
Sweetheart, please. Please. I tried 
this twenty minutes ago and it 
worked. I wouldn’t be bringing you 
down here if it didn’t.
STEVE
What worked?
ANNIE
(pause)
I wanna just show you.
STEVE
Show us what?!
ANNIE
(frustrated)
Fuck! I’m a - medium!
Before Steve can protest:
ANNIE
I was seeing apparitions earlier. I 
just shook them off, but I 
shouldn’t have.
83.
(gripping his hand)
Please: I know how it sounds. 
There’s no way to talk about it, I 
need to just show you. Okay? 
Please. You’ll see. I’m completely 
lucid.
Steve just stares at her. She looks pleadingly at him.
STEVE
(to Peter)
You can go to bed, Peter. I’ll 
stay.
ANNIE
What? No. What are you doing?
(to Peter)
Peter: please. This needs all of 
our energies. We need to do this as 
a family. Together.
PETER
(to Steve)
It’s okay, Dad. I’ll stay.
ANNIE
(to Steve)
Please Steve. I need you to be 
open. Both of you. I promise.
She holds out her hand, pleading for Steve’s. He reluctantly 
obliges. Again, she SQUEEZES both of their hands.
ANNIE
Okay, good. So I already read that 
earlier...
Annie nods to the prayer sheet that Joan gave her.
ANNIE
I don’t think I need to read it 
again.
Steve squints as he looks it over.
STEVE
What language is that?
ANNIE
(back to business)
Okay: Try to concentrate.
Annie now addresses the room.
84.
ANNIE
Charlie?... Charlie, are you here?
Steve looks ready to put an immediate stop to this, but he 
sees Annie’s total determination. He holds off.
In the other room, a door is heard CREAKING. Peter looks in 
that direction.
ANNIE
Charlie? It’s mommy. And daddy. And 
Peter.
Silence. Peter and Steve are very uneasy.
ANNIE
Charlie, if you’re in this room 
with us -- I’m going to have us all 
touch this glass.
Annie has PULLED Steve and Peter to the table. She rests her 
palm on top of the glass. She takes Steve’s hand and Peter’s 
hand. She lays them on top of hers.
ANNIE
(to Steve and Peter)
Don’t add pressure.
(to the room)
Now if you’re here, Charlie, I just 
want you to move the glass for us. 
Even if it’s just a tiny little 
bit.
STEVE
(needing to interject)
Annie.
ANNIE
(ignoring Steve)
Even if it’s just the tiniest 
little movement, Charlie!
A long stretch of nothing. Annie’s determination has not 
waned. Peter suddenly TENSES UP.
PETER
(to Steve)
What the hell?
STEVE
What’s wrong?
Max BARKS in the other room.
85.
PETER
You don’t feel that?
STEVE
What??
PETER
Like a - flexing. In the air.
THE DRINKING GLASS SUDDENLY MOVES.
Peter and Steve retract their hands.
STEVE
What the hell?
ANNIE
Wow! Yes! Thank you, Charlie! That 
was so good!
The color has drained from Peter’s face.
ANNIE
Now Charlie, what I’d like for you 
to do is I’d like for you to...
Annie opens the DRAWING PAD. She flips it to a blank page, 
and lays a small piece of PENCIL LEAD on top.
ANNIE
...show them what you were doing 
earlier.
Pause.
ANNIE
(to the room)
Can you show them what you just did 
for me?
PETER
Mom.
Intensely focused, Annie points to the pad.
ANNIE
Look: She’s gonna do it.
Peter looks to the pad, terrified. Steve SEES Peter’s fear.
Steve SHUTS the drawing pad.
STEVE
That’s enough.
86.
ANNIE
What? No!
Annie grabs the pad and flips to a PAGE near the back. It is 
a simple DRAWING - in Charlie’s style - of a CAR. She holds 
it up for Steve.
ANNIE
When I did this earlier, this 
materialized on the page! I saw 
this draw itself! I saw it!
PETER
Mom, what is this?
ANNIE
IT’S CHARLIE!
STEVE
ANNIE--
Cutting Steve off, Annie continues addressing the room.
ANNIE
Did you finish, Charlie?! Did you 
want to draw more?
She returns the drawing pad (now open to the car drawing) to 
the center of the table.
ANNIE
You can keep going if you weren’t 
finished!
Annie GRABS Steve’s and Peter’s hand, and presses them 
against the table again. She pushes her hands on top of 
theirs.
ANNIE
We need to keep our fingers 
touching. We need to give good 
energy.
Steve PULLS his hand away. Peter does, too. Annie SEIZES 
Peter’s wrist.
STEVE
This is SCARING him, Annie!
ANNIE
No it’s NOT!
ANNIE
(to Peter)
87.
Don’t be scared, Peter. This is 
your sister.
(to the room)
Charlie? Are you finished with the 
drawing?
Silence. Suddenly an intense GUST OF AIR sweeps the room 
(from the open window?) and the DOOR SLAMS SHUT. Max is now 
BARKING like crazy in the other room.
PETER
(very scared)
Mom?!
ANNIE
(to the room)
Charlie? What’s wrong?
The air seems to be sucked out of the room for a moment. The 
family is suspended in frightened anticipation. And then --
THE CANDLE’S FLAME BELCHES, as if fueled (for an instant) by 
propane. Everyone GASPS! The flame is immediately 
extinguished.
Silence now - save for Max, still barking in the other room.
We are left for a moment in darkness, and then... The 
candle’s wick quietly RE-IGNITES on its own. The flame now 
burns normally. Peter and Steve stare open-mouthed at this.
Steve looks under the table. Nothing is there. He warily 
lifts the candle to see if there’s anything attached to the 
bottom. There is not. Before Steve can react --
A FAINT GROANING SOUND is ushered. Peter and Steve, frozen 
for a moment, look nervously to the source. It’s coming 
from... ANNIE. Her head is down. She’s moaning, as if trying 
to vomit. She’s in some sort of TRANCE. Finally, she lets out 
a LONG, PAINED GROAN. Guttural and almost inhuman-sounding. 
It drags out longer than wanted. And then...
Annie stops. Her eyes are WIDE. Like a child’s. She then 
says:
ANNIE
Hello?
But her voice sounds different. It will now remind us - in 
inflection, in quality - of CHARLIE’S VOICE.
PETER
(horrified)
Mom?
88.
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Mom?
Annie looks around, as if looking for “Mom.” She looks very 
scared now (but she’s still squeezing Peter’s wrist).
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Mom?!
PETER
(to Steve)
I don’t like this.
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
What’s happening?!
PETER
(to Steve)
Dad! I don’t like this!
STEVE
(also afraid)
Annie...
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
What’s going on?!
Annie is still looking around, as if she can’t see. As if 
she’s BLIND.
PETER
(crying)
Mommy?!
Annie is crying now, too.
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Mom??
Mortified, Peter tugs on Steve’s arm.
PETER
Please, dad!
STEVE
(helpless)
ANNIE! STOP IT!
ANNIE
89.
(like Charlie)
What’s happening?! Why is everyone 
scared?!
Terrified silence.
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
WHY ARE YOU SCARING ME?!
More terrified silence.
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Dad! Peter! I’m scared! Where’s 
mom?!
PETER
(can’t take anymore)
DAD!
Steve runs to TURN ON THE LIGHTS. Annie is still possessed, 
looking blindly about the room.
Steve runs out of the room to go to the KITCHEN.
We stay with Annie and Peter.
PETER
(like Charlie)
Peter, what’s going on? Where’s 
mom? Stop it!
ANNIE
(like a scared animal)
Why are you trying to scare me?!
Steve re-enters the room, holding a GLASS OF WATER. He TOSSES 
it in Annie’s face. She GASPS - roused from her trance.
ANNIE
What the hell! What are you doing?!
Annie is frozen. She takes in her drenched body. Max has 
stopped barking in the other room.
ANNIE
What just happened?
Peter and Steve are traumatized.
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
103
103
90.
Steve has pulled Annie outside. He’s very aggressive. Annie 
has wiped the water off her face with a towel. In the b.g., 
Peter watches from a window.
STEVE
What the fuck did you just do?
ANNIE
I didn’t do anything!
STEVE
I swear to God, Annie--
ANNIE
You were there. You saw what 
happened. That wasn’t me.
A fraught beat. Steve stares daggers.
STEVE
What was that, Annie?
ANNIE
We communicated with Charlie.
STEVE
(meaning it)
Stop it.
ANNIE
You saw that we did!
STEVE
Did you happen to see your son in 
there? Did you even notice that 
he’s absolutely terrified?!
ANNIE
Are you sure you’re not terrified?
STEVE
I am terrified! I’m fuckin’ scared 
of you.
(definitively)
Tomorrow. We’re going to see Dr. 
Stetson.
Annie’s eyes go cold with recognition.
ANNIE
I don’t wanna see Dr. Stetson.
STEVE
91.
Well, I don’t wanna be conducting 
seances in my fucking dining room!
Steve storms inside. Annie follows him. She boils.
ANNIE
Goddamn it! Denial can be a crazy 
thing, too, Steve! To be so rigid!
But Steve keeps walking off.
ANNIE
HEY!
Steve pauses, also boiling.
ANNIE
What happened when I blacked out? 
Did something happen?
Steve just looks at her.
INT. ANNIE AND STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
104
104
The moonlight is an icy blue.
Annie and Steve are in bed. Steve is asleep with his back to 
Annie. Annie is too anxious to sleep.
She turns her face into her pillow, only to notice TWO ANTS 
crawling on the pillowcase. She looks down to see THREE MORE 
ANTS on the bed. She then pulls ONE ANT off of her shoulder.
Annie sits up. She looks down to see a TRAIL OF ANTS on the 
floor, leading into the hallway. The trail is coming from the 
WINDOW.
Annie gets out of bed and checks the window. It’s locked. But 
the trail seems to be COMING IN through a small gap in the 
corner of the sill.
Annie follows the trail of black ants out of the room and 
into the hallway...
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
105
105
The trail of ants is leading clearly to PETER’S BEDROOM. His 
door is open. (There is the faint sound of Max’s barking, as 
if heard from a great distance.)
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
106
106
92.
Annie enters Peter’s bedroom. The queue of ants continues 
toward Peter’s bed.
They crawl up the bed post and onto the mattress, continuing 
up Peter’s leg and across his body - all the way up to his 
neck.
Annie draws closer. As she approaches, it becomes horribly 
apparent...
THE BLACK ANTS HAVE COMPLETELY ENVELOPED PETER’S HEAD AND 
FACE.
PETER (V.O.)
Mom! What are you doing?!
CLOSE-UP OF ANNIE’S FACE. Her expression goes from horrified 
to confused. She looks up, unnerved, and takes in her 
surroundings. We cut WIDE to reveal:
Annie is standing in Peter’s dark room, but Peter is now 
sitting up in bed. There are no ants. It was all a dream?
ANNIE
What’s going on?
PETER
You were sleepwalking.
There is no audible room tone and the dialogue is strangely 
CRISP, as though being spoken in a dreamy vacuum. The only 
other sound is Max’s distant BARKING.
Annie looks extremely confused and afraid.
ANNIE
I’m sorry...
Annie looks around.
ANNIE
Is Charlie here?
PETER
Why are you scared of me?
ANNIE
(looking at him now)
What?
Annie’s expression pleads “How could you ask me that?” But 
Peter just stares back at her. Annie’s attitude suddenly 
TURNS - from defensive to confessional. She admits:
93.
ANNIE
I never wanted to be your mother.
Annie covers her mouth, as if in shock at her own words. She 
looks to Peter like a child who just accidentally broke 
something.
PETER
(emotional)
Why not?
ANNIE
(still covering mouth)
I was scared. I didn’t feel like a 
mother. But she pressured me.
PETER
Then why did you have me?
ANNIE
It’s not my fault...! I tried to 
stop it.
PETER
How?
ANNIE
(barely able to say it)
...I tried to have a miscarriage.
Peter starts tearing up.
PETER
How?
ANNIE
(also tearing up)
However I could...! I did 
everything they told me not to. But 
it didn't work. I’m happy it didn’t 
work!
Max’s muffled barking has become faintly more distinct. Peter 
is crying hard now.
PETER
You tried to kill me?
Annie, also crying, shakes her head.
ANNIE
I love you.
94.
We cut back to Peter, but his hair and face are now 
inexplicably DRENCHED in liquid (presumably paint thinner).
PETER
Why did you try to kill me?
We cut back to Annie, revealing that she's now drenched in 
paint thinner, too.
ANNIE
I didn’t. I was trying to save you.
An OFF-SCREEN FIRE IGNITES, illuminating Annie’s face in 
hellish orange.
MAX’S OFF-SCREEN BARKING HAS NOW BECOME VERY LOUD, VERY 
PRESENT. It reaches an almost unbearable pitch before we CUT 
TO:
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
107
107
ANNIE WAKES UP WITH A START. It was all a dream.
Max is barking wildly in the hallway.
A FLY lands on Annie’s face. Brushing it away, she notices 
that Steve’s side of the bed is EMPTY. His pillow is also 
GONE.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
108
108
Max’s barking persists in the b.g.
The lights are on. Peter, dressed in his pajamas, sits 
traumatized on the edge of his bed.
The composition of this shot (wide, high-angle) is MATCHED 
eerily on the CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY
109
109
Peter sits tensely in the back corner of his classroom.
The teacher stands at the blackboard, leading the class 
through an algebra lesson.
Peter’s mind is a storm. He’s brought fiercely into the 
present, however, when a strange, barely perceptible glint of 
LIGHT (we’ve seen this before) FLASHES across the room. The 
light ends at the WINDOW next to Peter.
95.
Peter looks around. Nobody else noticed it. Peter blinks a 
few times, concerned that he might be seeing things. He turns 
back to the window to see...
Peter’s REFLECTION is staring pointedly back at him.
The color drains from Peter’s face. He looks weakly back at 
his own reflection, whose eyes HARDEN bitterly against him.
Overwhelmed, Peter abruptly STANDS UP, distracting the 
teacher.
TEACHER
Yes, Peter?
PETER
(confused)
I - have to go to the bathroom.
Aware of Peter’s recent trauma, the Teacher is careful to be 
extra-sensitive.
TEACHER
That’s fine. Just take the pass.
Peter leaves, tears in his eyes.
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - DAY
110
110
Steve sits stiffly at the computer in his office. He has 
typed into his search engine “Paranormal evidence, voice 
channeling,” but he pauses and then DELETES this. He instead 
writes “Symptomatology and management of grief 
hallucinations.” He presses SEND.
Steve looks over the results, and then clicks on a separate 
tab. It’s a half-composed EMAIL to a fellow psychiatrist. The 
email reads...
Hi Bob,
I hesitate to write, but I’m worried that Annie might be on 
the verge of (or in the MIDDLE of)
He’s stuck on how to continue.
Steve’s cell phone rings. It’s an unknown number. He 
hesitates before answering it.
STEVE
Hello?
There’s a strange wave of STATIC and then...
96.
PETER (V.O.)
(almost whispering)
Dad?
STEVE
Peter?
We can hear that Peter is crying, near hysteria.
PETER (V.O.)
Something’s at the school.
STEVE
What is?
PETER
It followed me here!
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME
111
111
The cordless PHONE is ringing. Two FLIES crawl across it.
Annie, still wearing her nightgown, nervously works on a 
FUNERAL HOME model. The ringing STOPS, but then starts again.
Annie now turns to ANSWER the phone.
ANNIE
Hello?
Steve is on the other end. We can hear that he is DRIVING.
STEVE (V.O.)
(furious)
Can you guess who just called me 
from school in complete hysterics?
Annie goes pale.
ANNIE
(gravely)
Charlie?
STEVE (V.O.)
...What?
ANNIE
I -- nothing. What happened?
STEVE (V.O.)
97.
Peter just called me, Annie. 
Terrified. Crying in the halls. 
He’s convinced he’s being 
threatened by some vengeful spirit.
ANNIE
Why does he think he’s being 
threatened?
STEVE (V.O.)
(no patience)
Listen to me, Annie: I have a son 
to protect.
ANNIE
What does that mean?
STEVE (V.O.)
It means that’s what I’m worried 
about right now. That’s how I’m 
proceeding.
ANNIE
Don’t talk to me like this. He’s my 
son, too.
CLICK. He’s hung up.
Infuriated, Annie calls Steve back. He answers.
ANNIE
Don’t hang up on me again. I’m not 
sleepwalking anymore, you 
understand?
She hangs up.
Annie returns to the miniature funeral home. She carefully 
(but tensely) presses a freshly GLUED piece of balsa wood 
against the beautifully rendered wall. She holds it in place.
The phone RINGS. Annie doesn’t care. It rings until the 
ANSWERING MACHINE gets it. After the outgoing message, the 
machine BEEPS and a WOMAN leaves a message.
WOMAN (V.O.)
98.
Hi Annie! It’s Margaret at the 
Asher Gallery. I’m just calling to 
see how things are with you and 
your family - I hope everything’s 
okay - and also, just wondering, 
uh, how the progress is going. Not 
that you need reminding - haha - 
but we are a little less than nine 
weeks away, so it would just be 
nice to get the vaguest sense of 
where we are. So yeah, call me back 
whenever, and again, I really hope 
everything’s okay and our thoughts 
are all very much with your family, 
so - Okay. Thanks so much.
Click. BEEP.
Annie has grown extremely TENSE over the course of that 
message. Still applying pressure to the glued-on piece, she 
pushes a little too hard, and her thumb BREAKS THROUGH the 
miniature’s wall.
Annie FREEZES for a moment, shocked. Then, overcome by sheer 
frustration, she raises her FIST and SMASHES IT DOWN into the 
funeral home’s floor, SNAPPING it.
Taken by a surge of destructive rage, she SWEEPS the 
miniature off the table and rises to STOMP her foot through 
its roof. DESTROYING IT.
Without missing a beat, she grabs a HAMMER and proceeds to 
SMASH APART the rest of her miniatures. It’s a woeful, 
devastating fit. By the time Annie gets a grip on herself, 
it’s too late. All of the pieces have been destroyed. All 
except for one... The MINIATURE OF THE GRAHAM HOUSE.
Annie drops the hammer.
INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
112
112
Steve and Peter enter through the front door. A bad SMELL 
immediately hits them.
STEVE
Whoa. Jesus.
They proceed up the stairs. Steve swipes away a fly.
STEVE
Did something die in here?
99.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
113
113
Peter goes to his room, closing the door behind him.
Steve walks up to the WORKSHOP’s door. He opens it without 
knocking.
STEVE
(entering)
Annie, what is that smell--
But he FREEZES when he sees the state of the demolished room.
Annie sits in her chair, completely surrounded by smashed and 
splintered wood.
STEVE
(stunned)
...What happened?
He looks at Annie and almost immediately understands. She did 
this. His heart breaks.
ANNIE
I didn’t wanna look at it anymore.
Steve stares at her for a very long time. He then grabs the 
PHONE and storms into the hallway, dialing a number.
ANNIE
(rising)
Hey! Who are you calling?!
INT. HALLWAY - LATER
114
114
Through the upstairs hallway window, A CAR pulls up to park 
behind Steve’s car. A pleasant, well scrubbed man (50s) 
emerges to walk toward the house. This is DR. STETSON.
There is a KNOCK at the door. It is heard OPENING.
DR. STETSON (O.S.)
Hi Steve.
STEVE (O.S.)
Thanks for coming, Bob. Yeah: 
forgive the smell. I think 
something died in the walls.
Annie is standing in the upstairs hallway, listening.
STEVE (O.S.)
(sighs)
100.
She’s upstairs right now.
Annie takes this as her cue. She walks defiantly down the 
stairs. She arrives at the bottom, in the FOYER. Dr. Stetson 
acknowledges her with a big smile.
DR. STETSON
(warmly)
Hi Annie.
ANNIE
Dr. Stetson.
DR. STETSON
Can we all sit somewhere and talk?
ANNIE
(disdainful)
Yeah, let’s make ourselves at home.
Annie sits in a chair in the corner. Dr. Stetson takes a 
chair and brings it nearer. Stetson sits across from Annie, 
without crowding her. (A couple flies will be buzzing around 
throughout.)
DR. STETSON
How’s it going?
ANNIE
Not amazing.
DR. STETSON
Can you talk about why?
ANNIE
(blunt)
Uh - because my daughter was killed 
and now my psychiatrist husband is 
calling over his peers to 
investigate me.
Steve glowers.
DR. STETSON
Nobody’s investigating you, Annie.
Annie just stares at him.
DR. STETSON
Can I ask how you are?
ANNIE
101.
I’m fine. I’m lucid. I’m in 
mourning and I’m trying to cope, 
and he’s supposed to be my partner, 
so forgive me if I’m not bouncing 
off the walls to see you.
DR. STETSON
Nobody’s trying to do anything 
against you right now, Annie. I 
promise you.
ANNIE
Then stop patronizing me please.
Stetson takes a long pause. He levels with her:
DR. STETSON
What’s all this about ghosts? And 
seances?
ANNIE
(direct)
I thought I felt a presence. I was 
hopeful, as you can imagine. It was 
fleeting, and now I’m back to 
grieving.
DR. STETSON
Okay... All right.
(moving on)
And why did you destroy your work?
ANNIE
(turning back to Stetson)
Because it’s my work.
Annie’s eyes are stone. Brief pause.
DR. STETSON
(relenting)
Fair enough. So I’m gonna ask you 
some annoying questions now, Annie.
(making sure to not 
patronize)
I can see that you’re lucid. This 
is just simply what I have to do. 
Okay?
(first question)
What day is it?
ANNIE
Tuesday.
DR. STETSON
102.
When in the month?
LATER
Through the foyer window, we see Steve and Dr. Stetson 
OUTSIDE. This is from Annie’s POV.
Dr. Stetson seems to be explaining something to Steve. Steve 
nods, frustrated.
We see Dr. Stetson say “I’m sorry, I can’t” and then he walks 
off to his car. Steve sulks back toward the house.
Steve enters. He looks at Annie.
ANNIE
What were you hoping? That I'd tell 
your psychiatrist friend that we 
brought back our dead daughter? You 
think I don’t know how that sounds?
Steve nods, numb. He walks past her, toward the stairs. Annie 
pauses before following him up.
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER
115
115
Steve has entered the workshop. He walks heavily around the 
ruins.
Annie steps in. Watches him.
STEVE
You worked so hard for this show.
ANNIE
Jesus Christ - Fuck the show. 
You’re ignoring this!
STEVE
I’m not ignoring anything - believe 
me.
ANNIE
You ignore everything! If you can’t 
find it in one of your books!
Long pause.
STEVE
(tensely, measuredly)
I won’t indulge this behavior 
anymore.
103.
ANNIE
“Indulge”?
STEVE
I won’t. I can't allow it
ANNIE
“Allow” now! Jesus! Listen to
how you’re just clinging!
(pointing)
You’re the one who’s gonna go 
crazy, Steve. If you keep just 
denying what’s in front of you.
Steve stares at her, overwhelmed. He looks down to notice at 
his feet: the figurine of Annie’s Mother, holding out her 
breast. Steve lets out a defeated sigh.
STEVE
(tears building)
You know, Annie...
STEVE
You can still build a shrine to the 
terrible stuff. Doesn’t mean you 
have to destroy anything good.
ANNIE
Well, it’s not anything good. It’s 
nothing. It means nothing. This -
(kicks a piece of wood)
- is what I cared about.
STEVE
Except for that one.
Steve is pointing out the pristine Graham House replica. He 
looks it over. Something makes him chuckle bitterly to 
himself.
STEVE
Nice touch.
Annie looks at Steve, not understanding. She walks over to 
the miniature.
She sees that something has been ADDED to Peter’s bedroom. A 
HEADLESS FIGURINE (now wearing Peter’s clothes) is lying in 
Peter’s bed. The color drains from Annie’s face.
STEVE
I was wondering when Peter would 
get switched with Charlie.
104.
Annie is covering her mouth with her hands. She is having a 
horrible revelation. Her eyes then SCAN UP to notice 
something else...
The figurine of ANNIE (on her knees, face in her hands) is 
now in the ATTIC replica. The figurine is dressed in a 
NIGHTGOWN (the same one that Annie is wearing now), except 
its front is covered in blood.
Defeated, Steve leaves the room.
ANNIE
Where are you going?
STEVE
(bitterly)
I didn’t sleep at all last night. 
If you can believe it.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
116
116
Rattled and extremely tense, Steve sits at the couch, which 
is dressed with a blanket and pillow. He uncaps a 
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE (sleeping pills).
STEVE
(mumbling)
Always you - right Steve? You hold 
it all together.
He draws out TWO PILLS and knocks them back. He then 
hesitates before pulling out one more. He DOWNS it.
INT. WORKSHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT
117
117
Through the open door of the workshop (whose lights are now 
off), Peter is seen TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS in his bedroom. He 
looks out into the hall, paranoid, and then shuts the door.
Several FLIES adorn the hallway walls.
This was seen from ANNIE’S POV. She’s sitting in the dark, 
among the wreckage of her work. She’s still in shock over the 
inexplicable additions to the Graham replica.
Suddenly she HEARS the faint sound of a PENCIL VIGOROUSLY 
SCRATCHING PAPER. It’s coming from down the hall. She 
hesitates before rising and entering the HALLWAY... More and 
more flies have collected. They seem especially prominent 
around the ATTIC DOOR on the ceiling.
105.
Noting this, Annie continues to follow the sound of drawing 
to arrive at...
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
118
118
The door is open. The lights are OFF. The sound of PENCIL 
FEVERISHLY SCRATCHING PAPER is heard, although the room is 
completely empty.
Annie stands at the door. She hesitates before turning on the 
light.
CHARLIE’S DRAWING PAD rests on Charlie’s bed. It’s open to a 
mostly blank page, but a DRAWING IS MATERIALIZING on it. It 
is then FLIPPED (as if by wind) to the next page, where a new 
drawing begins. We can’t yet see the content of the drawings.
Annie approaches the drawing pad to investigate. Her eyes, 
already buzzing with fear, now widen with HORROR.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
119
119
The door is closed and the lights are off. Peter is in bed, 
trying to sleep. Silence, save for a buzzing fly. Then... A 
CLICKING of the tongue. Peter’s eyes OPEN. He slowly looks 
up, scanning past the bed, to SEE...
CHARLIE is standing in the dark corner of the room (where 
Peter mistook his hoodie for a person). Charlie stares at 
Peter with unblinking eyes. It’s almost too dark to make her 
out. Another CLICK.
PETER
Charlie?
A long silence. Charlie slowly opens her MOUTH, but then her 
head DROOPS forward and rolls OFF her shoulders. It tumbles 
to the floor and rolls toward Peter, but when it rolls into a 
block of moonlight (cast from the window), it’s revealed to 
be a Nerf basketball.
Peter glares at the ball. A quiet GROWLING is heard from the 
door. Peter looks up.
The door is now OPEN and Max stands in the doorway. He seems 
to be disturbed by Peter - or rather, by something standing 
behind Peter.
PETER
(terrified)
What is it, Max?
106.
Suddenly TWO HANDS materialize from behind Peter’s head. They 
grab his face, grasping under his chin. They TUG BACK on his 
head, as if trying to yank it off. Peter SCREAMS.
Max runs in to attack, but the DOOR SLAMS IN HIS FACE.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
120
120
Max paws aggressively at the door, barking wildly.
Suddenly, Max’s HIND LEGS are lifted, as if by invisible 
hands, and TUGGED back by a great, vacuuming force. He is 
SUCKED across the hall and down the stairs. We FOLLOW the 
mortified dog as it’s pulled all the way down to the FOYER.
The FRONT DOOR IS OPEN and Max is deposited violently out of 
the house. The door SLAMS SHUT.
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
121
121
Steve is FAST ASLEEP on the couch.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Peter! Peter!
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
122
122
Peter has just been released by the phantom hands. He’s 
frantic. ANNIE is now standing in the room.
ANNIE
What’s wrong, baby?! What 
happened?!
PETER
What are you doing?!
ANNIE
What do you mean?!
PETER
You were pulling on my head!
ANNIE
What?!
Peter looks terrified of her.
ANNIE
No I wasn’t! I just came in! You 
were screaming!
107.
Peter is crying.
ANNIE
What happened?
PETER
I saw Charlie in the corner and 
then you started pulling on my 
head.
ANNIE
Peter! I would never do that to 
you! Are you crazy? I would never 
hurt you. How could you even think 
that?
Peter just stares at her through frightened tears.
ANNIE
...You saw Charlie in what corner?
Peter can’t answer. He’s horrified.
ANNIE
Listen to me, Peter. I don’t know 
what’s happening or what you just 
saw, but I’m stopping this. Do NOT 
tell dad what you just said to me. 
Please. It’s NOT true. Something’s 
going on, and I’m the only one who 
can stop this. Do you understand? 
I’m the only one who can fix it.
Peter stares unblinkingly at her.
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
123
123
Charlie’s DRAWING PAD is open. We track slowly in, revealing 
the CONTENT of two of the drawings...
Both are crude, violently drawn sketches of PETER’S FACE, but 
the EYES are replaced with X’s. The faces are framed by 
furiously sketched TRIANGLES.
A BREEZE blows in from the window, flipping to the NEXT PAGE 
- more of the same - and then the next page - still more of 
the same - and then the next page, etc...
Annie’s HAND enters to seize the drawing pad. She leaves the 
room.
Max’s barking persists in the b.g.
108.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
124
124
Annie has started a FIRE in the fireplace. (In the b.g., 
Steve is still asleep on the couch.)
Annie clutches Charlie’s drawing pad, gazing into the fire.
She inhales deeply, holds her breath, and then THROWS the pad 
in. At first it resists the flames, but then, the EDGE of one 
sheet begins to BURN.
Annie watches this, eyes glued to the fire. But the shoulder 
of her SHIRT has sprouted the tiny beginning of a FLAME. It 
is the same size as the burgeoning flame at the drawing pad’s 
edge. Annie doesn’t even notice.
The flame spreads slowly along the drawing pad’s edge. As 
this happens, the flame on Annie’s shoulder SPREADS ALONG HER 
ARM. Annie notices this and panics. She desperately tries to 
stamp out the fire, but it’s no use.
The fireplace-fire starts to CONSUME the edges of the drawing 
pad. Simultaneously, ANNIE’S ARM IS ENGULFED FOR A MOMENT IN 
FLAMES. The fire on her arm is mimicking the fire that’s 
eating the book.
Annie SCREAMS, pulls the drawing pad out of the fire, and 
STAMPS OUT the flames. As she stamps it out, the fire on her 
arm is duly EXTINGUISHED.
Annie understands now. She’s tied to the book.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
125
125
The MOON hangs large over the house. We then SLAM CUT to 
MORNING. The moon has been replaced by a shrill SUN.
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
126
126
Peter steps out of his bedroom, backpack slung over his 
shoulder. He clearly didn’t sleep last night and his eyes are 
buzzing with anxiety. He looks down the hall at the 
workshop’s DOOR, which is open by the faintest CRACK. He 
hesitates and walks off.
Behind the workshop door: ANNIE stares through the crack, 
making sure that Peter leaves.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
127
127
109.
Annie, looking frighteningly determined, emerges from the 
elevator of JOAN’S BUILDING. She’s still wearing her 
nightgown under a coat. She rushes to JOAN’S DOOR and knocks.
No answer.
Annie knocks again, more urgently.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
128
128
Nobody’s home. We are pulling back from the DOOR (as Annie’s 
knocking persists) to REVEAL the apartment...
It looks mostly the same, but it’s now adorned in cloths and 
drapes that feature various SYMBOLS. One of these is an 
ORNATE SIGIL (which we recognize as the one on Annie’s 
necklace). This is the Sigil of PAIMON, and it can now be 
found all over the room.
The TABLE at which Annie and Joan performed the seance (which 
was then covered in a table-cloth) is now bare, revealing 
that the tabletop has a LARGE TRIANGLE carved into it 
(pointing to the northwest). Resting in the middle of the 
triangle is a PHOTO OF PETER. Beside this is an ATHAME 
(ritual dagger), a scattering of herbs, and finally... A 
primitive DIORAMA (the same that we saw earlier on Charlie’s 
desk, but now finished). Standing center stage is a crude 
manikin of a human torso whose head is an actual SEVERED 
RAVEN HEAD. Atop the head is an aluminum-foil CROWN.
Three other sculptures BOW ON THEIR KNEES to the raven-headed 
figure. Their heads are the severed PIGEON HEAD (now 
decomposing), a severed RAT HEAD and a severed SQUIRREL HEAD.
Annie’s knocking continues.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
129
129
Annie ceases knocking. She looks DOWN to notice that she’s 
standing on...
The WELCOME MAT. “JOANIE.”
Annie’s mind starts racing. She thinks for a moment and then 
- it hits her! Annie RACES back to the elevator.
A SCHOOL BELL RINGS, bridging our CUT TO:
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
130
130
110.
LUNCH TIME. It’s overcast, dark and windy. Students mill 
about in flapping clothes.
Just beyond the high school fence is a ROAD with heavy 
traffic. PETER is seated at an empty table near the fence, 
eating (or rather, not eating) the cafeteria food.
The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and imposing. Peter LISTENS to it, 
losing himself in the white noise. But there’s something 
looming underneath the traffic noise...
It’s like a distant YELLING, but too distant to make out.
Slowly it becomes clearer, more distinct. It’s a WOMAN’S 
VOICE and it’s yelling “Peter.”
Peter looks up. Where is it coming from?
WOMAN’S VOICE
(still vague)
...I expel you...!
Peter looks around. Soon his eyes settle on something... 
Across the road, on a far sidewalk, JOAN is standing. She 
looks raving mad. She’s staring directly at Peter and she’s 
screaming like a lunatic.
JOAN
SATONY, DEGONY, EPARIGON!
Terrified, Peter rises from his seat. He looks around to see 
if anyone else is noticing this. Nobody is.
JOAN
PETER!
Peter looks back at her. They MEET EYES.
JOAN
GET OUT, PETER!
Peter breaks the gaze. He looks around, appealing to any/all 
of the circulating kids. It’s clear that none of them see or 
hear this. How is that possible?
JOAN (O.S.)
PETER!!!
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - DAY
131
131
Annie runs in from the hallway.
111.
She rushes to the BOXES marked “Mom’s Things.” She opens the 
first box and finds a HAND-EMBROIDERED WELCOME MAT. It’s the 
exact same style as Joan’s. Embroidered into it is the name 
“ANNIE”. Under that is another mat, bearing the name 
“CHARLES” and featuring the now-familiar sigil of PAIMON.
Annie goes to the next box. She dig through a collection of 
herbs and oils, and beneath those, she finds a familiar 
hardback: NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM. Below this, a couple other 
hardbacks: one that appears to be a GRIMOIRE (book of spells) 
and the other titled INVOCATIONS.
INVOCATIONS’ cover features an esoteric sigil. Annie opens 
the book to find that it’s filled with vivid etchings of 
DEMONIC POSSESSION RITUALS.
Annie goes to a MARKED PAGE. It features an illustration of a 
beastly man with a hulking body and a strangely effeminate 
face. He rides a dromedary and wears a crown. Tied to his hip 
is a collection of SEVERED HEADS. Behind him is a queue of 
frolicking ghouls, all headless and all playing instruments.
A title reads “King Paimon (God of Mischief).” Annie finds a 
HIGHLIGHTED PARAGRAPH: "When successfully invoked, Paimon 
will possess the most vulnerable host. Only when the ritual 
is complete will Paimon be locked into his ordained host. 
Once locked in, a new ritual is required to unlock the 
possession."
A sentence underlined in pencil reads: "Paimon is Male, thus 
covetous of a male human body."
The next page features an etching of a man sitting atop a 
mountain of treasure. A caption reads: “The riches to the 
conjurer.”
Annie comes to the TITLE PAGE of the book. There is a 
handwritten NOTE. It reads:
My darling, dear, beautiful Annie,
Forgive me all the things I could not tell you, as I truly 
could not. Please don’t hate me and try not to despair your 
losses. You will see in the end that they were worth it.
Our sacrifice will pale next to the rewards.
Love, Mommy
Mortified, Annie throws the book into the box, and digs 
deeper to find TWO PHOTO ALBUMS, familiarly titled 
“Memories.”
112.
Annie flips through one of the albums. For a while, nothing 
of note. But then she FINDS something...
A PHOTO of ANNIE’S MOTHER, 20 years younger, standing with 
JOAN, also 20 years younger. They both wear replicas of 
Annie’s NECKLACE - the one bearing the now-familiar sigil of 
Paimon.
Stunned, Annie continues through the photo album. She finds 
SEVERAL MORE PHOTOS FEATURING JOAN, who’s often standing in 
the background. Always wearing the necklace. She and Annie’s 
Mother were evidently close friends.
Another photo: Annie’s mother guides a baby bottle into BABY 
CHARLIE’s mouth. The bottle’s milk is polluted with black 
herbs.
Finally, Annie comes to a particularly bizarre photo. It 
features Joan pouring gold/silver coins over Annie’s Mother’s 
head. Annie’s Mother, wearing a tiara, is weeping/laughing 
tears of joy. They are surrounded by an intimate, APPLAUDING 
audience.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
132
132
Students are returning to class.
Peter walks trembling down the hall. Any lingering kids 
disperse to enter their classrooms. Peter approaches his 
classroom, a gnawing apprehension taking him over.
Suddenly, from behind Peter, a FLASH of light STREAKS across 
the length of the hall. It sweeps past Peter. He FREEZES.
The light seems to disappear at Peter’s CLASSROOM. Peter 
stares at the door.
Through the door’s window, MR. DAVIES (the teacher) turns to 
see Peter. They lock eyes. Davies smiles expectantly.
Feeling pressured, Peter walks to the classroom. He ENTERS.
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
133
133
The hallway is crawling with flies.
Annie, still holding the photo album, enters (from the 
Workshop) to investigate.
The ceiling’s ATTIC HATCH is now covered in more flies than 
ever. It’s clearly the source of the infestation.
113.
Annie, eyes crazed with paranoia, stares at the hatch. A 
short (but accessible) rope hangs from it, asking to be 
pulled.
Annie pulls on the rope, slowly OPENING the attic hatch and 
releasing its retractable stairway. A HORDE OF FLIES escapes 
the attic.
Annie hesitates before climbing up.
INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
134
134
The attic is dank and claustrophobic. There is one window, 
letting in scant moonlight. Otherwise, the space is obscured 
in utter darkness.
Annie pokes her head in. At the foot of the entrance is a 
FLASHLIGHT. Annie takes it, turns it on, and shines its beam 
into the shadows.
Flies are everywhere. Their buzzing permeates the room.
Waving away the flies, Annie explores the space. It’s filled 
with discarded pieces of the family’s past. Old cribs, a 
mattress, toys, etc.
Finally, Annie’s FLASHLIGHT dawns on something. A FIGURE 
lying prostrate in the corner. Annie approaches it. The flies 
get louder. Annie finally gets close enough to SEE... It is a 
WOMAN’S CORPSE, and upon closer inspection, its HEAD is seen 
to be MISSING. From the white and wrinkled hands, it’s 
evident that this was an old woman. She is also wearing a 
WHITE SILK ROBE - identical to the one that Charlie saw the 
corpse wearing earlier in the woods. (Is this Ellen Leigh’s 
corpse?) A large TRIANGLE has been drawn in chalk around the 
body.
Annie GASPS, staggers back, and bends over to RETCH. As she 
does so, the flashlight’s beam crosses something on the 
VAULTED CEILING above the body. Annie pauses before raising 
the flashlight. She trains it on the ceiling to reveal... THE 
SIGIL OF PAIMON has been painted onto the ceiling in now-dry 
BLOOD. Flies crawl across its coarse black-red strokes.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
135
135
Peter sits at the back of the class. He WRINGS his hands, 
anxiety mounting. He’s still thinking about the woman (Joan) 
who was yelling at him.
Mr. Davies stands at the chalkboard. Written on the board: 
“Punishment brings wisdom.”
114.
MR. DAVIES
So, everyone feels justified: 
Iphigenia’s murder was commanded by 
the gods - so really Agamemnon had 
no choice. And Clytemnestra is 
driven by revenge, just like 
Orestes when he returns...
Suddenly, Peter hears something behind him. A distant 
CLICKING of the tongue. We focus in on Peter’s EAR. Separated 
by a few seconds each, the clicks become clearer and more 
present with every CLICK. It’s as if the source is nearing.
Soon it’s loud enough to be RIGHT NEXT TO PETER’S FACE.
Suddenly, as seen from behind, PETER’S ARM SPIKES UP INTO THE 
AIR. Because we’re behind him, we don’t see Peter’s face. The 
tense arm is HELD there, as if being pulled by an unseen 
force. The clicking sound continues.
Mr. Davies turns to notice Peter.
MR. DAVIES
(calling on him)
Peter.
Mr. Davies waits, but after a moment, his expression darkens 
into concern.
MR. DAVIES
Peter, are you okay?
We now reveal PETER. His face is CONTORTED with terrible 
stress, as if his head were gripped by an electric vice. His 
eyes are locked open; his eyeballs darting around, as if 
appealing for help. His hand remains stiffly raised and he 
seems to have difficulty breathing. In fact, his face is 
about to turn purple.
PETER CLICKS HIS TONGUE. He’s now the one clicking.
MR. DAVIES
Peter. What’s wrong?
Bridget, staring at Peter, looks especially disturbed. Peter 
CLICKS again.
MR. DAVIES
I...
Suddenly Peter GASPS a horrible, gurgling gasp. It sounds 
like an agonized SQUEAL, much like the one we heard from 
Charlie during her allergic attack (before her decapitation).
115.
BRIDGET
(terrified)
Can he breathe?!
A spit-bubble forms on Peter’s lips as he struggles 
hopelessly to speak. But then--
Peter’s head is SLAMMED FACE-DOWN into his desk. It holds 
there, trembling with tension. His face is SMEARED across the 
desktop, as if a great pressure is being applied to the back 
of his head. One can almost hear Peter’s nose CRUNCHING.
Peter’s head suddenly swings back up, as if being YANKED by 
the hair. He is held upright for a moment, revealing that his 
eyes are pitch-red with tears. His nose is also bleeding 
lightly. He looks extremely disoriented.
PETER
MOM!
Peter’s head is SLAMMED back down, into the table. Blood 
BURSTS out of his now-broken nose.
The class screams!
Peter, suddenly in possession of his faculties, KICKS himself 
back. He stumbles out of his chair, knocking over the desk as 
he staggers backward. He has been RELEASED from whatever was 
just gripping him.
He SCREAMS, throwing his arms around, fending off whatever it 
was. He breaks down in SOBS, fraught with terror.
The class is completely silent.
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - DAY
136
136
A haggard Steve sits in his office, nursing a scotch.
His cell phone VIBRATES. It’s ANNIE.
Steve just stares at it. Letting it vibrate. It stops.
After a moment, the office phone RINGS. He looks at it.
Thinks about answering. Doesn’t.
He turns in his chair, raising the scotch to his lips.
Ignoring the phone. He downs the glass.
We now reveal the office phone’s CALLER ID. This call is 
coming from Peter’s High School.
116.
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
137
137
The land-line rings. It’s the high school, now calling the 
Graham house.
Nobody is home.
INT. CAR - SAME TIME
138
138
Annie sits in her car, parked on the street. She is waiting 
in the driver seat, eyes crazed. She watches the house, 
holding her cell phone at the ready.
A car drives by. She turns to investigate. It’s not Steve.
ANNIE
(to herself)
Goddamn it, Steve. Come home.
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
139
139
Steve is still in his office, eyes closed, leaning back in 
his chair. Clinging to the peace.
The phone rings again. He sets his drink on the table and 
grudgingly answers.
STEVE
Hello?
Pause. Steve suddenly becomes alert.
STEVE
What? What happened?
(listens for a moment)
STEVE
Okay. Yes. I’m coming now. Which 
hospital?
INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
140
140
Steve is now driving home. PETER is asleep in the back seat.
His nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED and his eyes are black and blue.
Steve looks at the rear-view mirror while he drives. Watches 
his son sleep.
Steve looks back to the road to see -- he’s about to run a 
red light. He STOMPS on the brake.
117.
Despite the harsh stop, Peter remains asleep.
Steve grips the wheel, on the edge of his seat. A moment of 
tense silence and then: the floodgates open. Steve starts 
CRYING, overwhelmed. After a moment of this, he regains 
composure.
The light goes GREEN.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
141
141
Annie is still waiting anxiously in her car.
Steve’s car is seen pulling into the Graham driveway. Annie 
heaves a relieved sigh - “finally!” But then she notices that 
Steve is pulling an unconscious Peter out of the back seat.
She sees Peter’s bandaged nose and PANICS.
Annie jumps out of the car and bounds over. She’s gripping 
her mother’s photo album.
ANNIE
Oh my God what happened?!
Steve turns to Annie as she arrives. He’s in no mood for any 
histrionics. Annie GASPS at the sight of Peter’s face.
ANNIE
Who did that?!
STEVE
He did apparently. Smashed his own 
face into his desk, hard enough to 
break it.
This only feeds Annie’s paranoia. She covers her mouth with 
her hands.
ANNIE
(needing to tell him)
Steve...
STEVE
(blunt)
Please: just take his feet.
Annie hesitantly gathers Peter’s feet. Steve proceeds toward 
the house, carrying Peter by his underarms.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - DAY
142
142
118.
Outside, Max’s BARKING is heard. It will persist through the 
following scene.
Steve and Annie lay the comatose Peter into bed. Steve looks 
down at Peter, sapped. He’s avoiding Annie’s eyes.
ANNIE
Steve.
Steve waits for her to continue.
ANNIE
...Upstairs, in the attic... When 
you were gone, I went up there.
Steve closes his eyes, not wanting to hear whatever’s coming.
ANNIE
There’s a decapitated body. An old 
woman....
Steve’s eyes open, numb. He looks blankly at Annie.
ANNIE
(reacting)
That’s what all the flies are!
STEVE
(zero inflection)
A body?
ANNIE
Go upstairs. Look for yourself.
STEVE
Whose body?
ANNIE
I think it might be my mother’s. I 
think! I can’t tell! The skin is 
black and she’s all distended, but 
it’s an old woman and the head is 
gone... Go see for yourself.
Steve STARES at her before walking into the hall and 
approaching the attic hatch.
ANNIE
And then there’s more.
STEVE
More than your mother’s headless 
body. Of course.
119.
Steve reaches for the attic hatch. He pulls it down and a 
mass of FLIES escapes.
Steve pauses, now much more nervous about what he’s about to 
find. He begins to climb the stairs.
Annie now RUNS downstairs...
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
143
143
Annie rushes to the fireplace. She starts a FIRE.
Max’s barking continues off-screen.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
144
144
The hatch is still open. We hear from within the attic:
STEVE (O.S.)
Jesus fuck!
Annie has run back upstairs.
Sounds of distress (from above) as Steve rushes to the stairs 
and stumbles down into the hallway. He’s pale with shock.
STEVE
What the fuck!
ANNIE
There’s more.
STEVE
Why haven’t you called the police?!
ANNIE
The police can’t help us!
This makes Steve pause. Did Annie do this?
STEVE
Who is that, Annie?
Annie squeezes her mother’s photo album.
ANNIE
Do you remember Joan, my friend? 
Her grandson died and she took me 
to her apartment?
Steve’s eyes are harrowed.
120.
STEVE
(to himself)
It did look like your mother.
ANNIE
Listen! She taught me how to do the 
seance. I didn’t even want to know. 
But she brought her grandson back, 
and I saw it and I felt it - just 
like you did with Charlie.
Steve eyes Annie with growing revulsion. She now opens the 
photo album. She’s frighteningly energetic.
ANNIE
This was my mother’s album. Okay? 
Now look: this woman, right here, 
that’s her! That’s Joan!
Annie is pointing at a photo of Joan (20 years younger) 
standing with Annie’s mother (20 years younger). Annie speaks 
quickly to prevent Steve from interrupting.
ANNIE
She never mentioned knowing my 
mother and I never met her before, 
but she approached me, she consoled 
me, and she told me about the 
seance, she showed me how, and now 
- look:
Steve can’t listen to this, but Annie desperately draws his 
attention to the photo of Annie’s Mother being showered in 
coins by Joan. Annie points at the NECKLACE.
ANNIE
That’s the necklace my mom gave me. 
Right? It’s my mother’s necklace. 
Right?
Now Annie points out another photo: her mother posing with 
Joan - both wearing the same necklace.
ANNIE
They’re both wearing it. And 
they’re wearing it in every photo!
Steve, now completely pale, doesn’t react. He’s staring at 
Annie like she’s a contagious disease.
ANNIE
And look at the pattern! Did you 
see up there? This was painted 
above the body. Right?! In blood?!
121.
STEVE
(dawning on him)
...You dug up the grave.
ANNIE
What?!
STEVE
It was you, wasn’t it? When you 
were going out, “to the movies”?
ANNIE
You’re not even listening!
STEVE
(horrified)
And when the cemetery called...
(outraged at the thought)
I didn’t tell you because I didn’t 
want to worry you.
ANNIE
Goddamn it! LISTEN to me, Steve! I 
know you don’t trust me - there’s 
nothing I can do about that - but 
they put a curse on us, and when we 
brought back Charlie -
STEVE
We didn’t bring back Charlie!
ANNIE
(continuing)
- we made a PACT with something! I 
don’t know what it is, but it’s in 
the house and it wants Peter!
Annie pulls out Charlie’s DRAWING PAD. She opens it and flips 
through the sketches of Peter with his eyes X’d out.
ANNIE
I watched these pages fill. They’re 
all of Peter.
She looks up at Steve.
ANNIE
I’m sorry, Steve: I don’t know what 
I did, but Peter’s in danger and 
I’m the one who started this.
Annie takes Steve’s arm. He recoils at his wife’s touch. She 
leads him toward the STAIRS.
122.
ANNIE
If we destroy this book, it’ll take 
me too. I tried to burn it - I 
tried - but my arm caught fire. On 
its own. As if I was linked to it, 
because I am linked! I know that 
now. But if we don’t destroy 
this...Peter will...
She’s too overwhelmed to finish her thought. Steve’s eyes 
register no compassion. He skeptically follows her down the 
stairs toward the LIVING ROOM.
ANNIE
It needs to be me, Steve. It’s my 
fault! I need you to throw it in 
the fire.
Steve just stares at her.
ANNIE
I can’t do it! I can’t throw it in! 
I’m too scared. But if you don’t, 
it’ll be Peter. I know it will.
(breaks down crying at 
the thought)
It’ll be our son!
Annie puts the drawing pad in Steve’s hand. She closes his 
fingers around it. She tries to calm herself down.
ANNIE
Please baby. I can’t do it. I need 
you to throw it in the fire.
Annie takes a canister of LIGHTER FLUID and proceeds to DOUSE 
the drawing pad. She then looks at Steve with great love and 
sadness.
ANNIE
Even if you can’t believe me: 
You’re the love of my life.
Annie KISSES him passionately. It has the desperation of a 
farewell kiss. Steve’s lips are stone.
ANNIE
I love you, Steve. I love you so 
much. And I love Peter so much!
Annie is crying hysterically. Max’s barking continues.
ANNIE
Please! Throw it in!
123.
Steve walks in a horrified daze toward the FIREPLACE. But 
then -- he STOPS SHORT. He turns to Annie.
STEVE
I’m not doing this anymore with 
you, Annie.
ANNIE
(panicked)
What? No.
STEVE
This isn’t helping you. You’re very 
sick and I need to call the police.
That does it. Annie storms toward Steve, SEIZES the drawing 
pad, runs to the fireplace, and HURLS the book into the fire.
It is immediately CONSUMED by the flames, and then, like 
clockwork--
STEVE IGNITES INTO A RAGING BALL OF FLAMES. He cries out as 
he is instantaneously swallowed up by the screaming fire.
Annie can’t even scream. She’s frozen in horror. Her eyes are 
LOCKED on the sight of her husband’s burning. And what’s 
more, the ominous STREAK OF LIGHT has returned - now bouncing 
wildly around the room. Max’s off-screen BARKING has reached 
an insane pitch.
We see Steve’s searing reflection in Annie’s fixed pupil. The 
fire is impossibly violent. Now, at the scene’s shrieking 
apex, the streak of light settles on Annie - entering her!
SLAM TO BLACK
Silence.
A distant drumming fades in...
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
145
145
The WOODED AREA behind the Graham house. It’s snowing.
A drum circle seems to be in progress somewhere unseen.
Repetitive, minimal PERCUSSION (like subdued war drums) 
thumps faintly and steadily in the distance.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
146
146
Silence. Max’s barking has STOPPED.
124.
Peter’s eyes blink OPEN from his deep sleep. He bolts up with 
a start. He’s in his room, under the covers.
He squints with pain. He reaches to touch his nose, but 
discovers the heavy plaster bandage.
Outside Peter’s window: the TREEHOUSE. A dim, golden light - 
like candlelight - flickers from within.
Peter stares at it. The drums are barely heard in the b.g.
They will continue.
The drums are momentarily drowned out by the sound of a CAR 
DRIVING BY outside. Its HEADLIGHTS gently illuminate Peter’s 
room, scanning the walls (in pale blue) as the car drifts by.
For the briefest moment, in this fleeting light, we see... 
ANNIE, still wearing her nightgown, in the top corner of the 
room. She seems to be FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY. She’s so 
elevated, in fact, that her head is turned to the side and 
her cheek pressed against the ceiling.
There’s something still and composed about her; something 
resolutely NOT Annie. Her eyes are WIDE and her face 
expressionless. She’s behind Peter, STARING at his back. He 
doesn’t notice.
The car has now passed, and the room is obscured again in 
darkness. Annie is no longer clearly visible.
Peter senses something behind him. He pauses, listens. Then 
he begins to TURN.
Annie, back pressed against the wall, scrambles (in a silent 
panic) across the wall and OUT the door. She seems to be 
CRAB-WALKING across the wall’s surface.
Peter looks back just as Annie has left. He didn’t see her.
Peter climbs out of bed. He goes to leave the bedroom.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
147
147
As Peter enters the hallway, a SHARP CLANGING SOUND is heard 
downstairs. Peter freezes. A sustained REVERB fills the 
house. It sounded like it came from a piano.
Peter remains motionless, listening.
PETER
Dad?
125.
Flies are everywhere.
Peter walks over to his parents’ BEDROOM.
He peers in. It’s empty.
He turns back to the hall.
PETER
Mom? Dad?
Peter looks up at the ATTIC HATCH, now closed. The SOUND OF 
FLIES is especially aggressive up there.
He then notices that ANNIE’S MOM’S BEDROOM DOOR IS OPEN. He 
looks inside. EMPTY. He closes the door.
Peter continues warily down the hall. He approaches the 
stairs.
PETER
Hello?
Peter leans to peer down the stairs. He sees nothing. He 
slowly proceeds downward.
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
148
148
Peter arrives at the bottom of the stairs. The foyer is 
empty.
Peter notices the PIANO. It seems to have been tampered with.
The lid is open and a couple of the wires have been SNAPPED.
Peter carefully walks through the foyer, eyes scanning 
around. Paranoia building.
He approaches the LIVING ROOM, which is faintly illuminated 
by an off-screen flame.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
149
149
Peter stops at the doorway. His eyes travel across the walls 
to finally come to...
The FIREPLACE. The last of a dim fire (mostly embers) 
crackles in the pit. And lying before the fireplace is... A 
CHARRED, BLACK CORPSE. It lies twisted on the rug.
Peter stands frozen, trying to discern what it is. He takes a 
reluctant step forward and slowly approaches the dark figure.
126.
Peter finally comes close enough to SEE...
The body’s HEAD has been violently AMPUTATED. The PINK/RED of 
the exposed neck contrasts garishly with the crisped whole.
The body is on its back, arched and contorted.
Peter looks at the HANDS. The fingers are curled into 
desperate claws. One finger bears STEVE’S WEDDING RING.
Peter opens his mouth to scream, but all that comes out is a 
muted gust of air. Tears well in his eyes. He can’t even 
summon the strength to look away. And above him... ANNIE is 
huddled up into a corner of the ceiling. Her face is twisted 
with grief and fear, and she is shaking her head - “no, no, 
no, no, no” - as if pleading with the back of Peter’s head, 
like a frightened animal. She holds PIANO WIRE, pulling it 
taut with both hands. Wringing blood.
Peter FREEZES, sensing something behind him. He slowly turns, 
but not toward Annie...
Peter looks to the other corner of the room. The CLOSET DOOR 
is cracked open. Peter SQUINTS at it. Standing in the dark 
closet, barely visible, is a MAN IN A RED CLOAK - staring at 
him.
Peter is paralyzed.
He then SENSES something in the corner of the ceiling - where 
Annie was. His eyes scan tensely to the corner, but Annie is 
now GONE.
Pregnant silence.
Suddenly, from behind Peter, Annie BURSTS SCREAMING out of 
the darkness, dashing towards him.
Peter RUNS squealing out of the room. He sprints for the 
STAIRS.
Peter bounds up the staircase, but at the top step, he trips 
over his own foot. He crashes to his knees, scrambling to get 
back up. Behind him, we hear Annie pursuing.
Peter races madly through the HALLWAY. The attic hatch is now 
inexplicably OPEN. He dashes for the ATTIC STAIRS.
He runs up the stairs and immediately RETRACTS them - just as 
Annie reaches him. Peter manages to pull the attic hatch 
SHUT, almost catching Annie’s bloody fingers.
INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
150
150
127.
Peter LOCKS the floor’s hatch. There is a mad POUNDING from 
beneath.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
151
151
Annie is UPSIDE DOWN and straddling the ceiling (as though 
gravity were no longer a thing). She pulls at the attic knob, 
SLAMMING her head into the hatch.
She bangs her head crazily against the ceiling, over and 
over. With every strike, she POUNDS her forehead harder and 
more wildly against the hatch - like a mad bull, trying to 
break through by sheer force.
INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
152
152
Peter stands in the dark, screaming and crying as the 
pounding persists. It keeps growing harder, faster, more 
insane - until it STOPS.
Peter listens... Nothing. Just the shrill cacophony of 
buzzing flies. Beside him, at his feet, is a dwindling BLACK 
CANDLE.
PETER
(terrified)
Mommy?
Peter looks up. BLACK CANDLES HAVE BEEN SET UP ALL AROUND THE 
ATTIC. Their flames dimly illuminate the clutter.
Peter now looks to the CORNER that earlier enshrined the 
headless corpse. The corpse is now gone, but something tiny 
has replaced it. The distance and weak light preclude Peter 
from identifying it.
Peter begins to approach the corner, tears streaming. He sees 
the bloody sigil on the vaulted ceiling above. As he walks, 
the buzzing gets LOUDER, more concentrated.
Peter continues warily toward the corner, his fear rising.
The buzzing has gotten even louder. Finally Peter gets close 
enough to SEE...
In the center of the chalk-etched triangle is a PHOTOGRAPH OF 
PETER WITH HIS EYES X’d OUT.
Stunned and confused, Peter REELS back, knocking over a 
candle. The corner goes dark. Peter is weeping uncontrollably 
now. He starts backing away, toward the room’s center. His 
eyes remain glued to his photograph.
128.
PETER
(to himself, crying)
Please. This isn’t happening. You 
need to wake up.
Peter’s teeth are chattering. He’s hyperventilating. His 
trembling silhouette is framed by the WINDOW behind him.
Outside the window: dreamy snowfall.
Peter continues backing up, but something makes him FREEZE. A 
prolonged GROAN, accompanied by the sound of WIRE being 
wrapped and tightened around FLESH. It’s coming from a source 
about twenty feet away, BEHIND him. This is followed by a 
swifter, HARSHER SOUND - like a saw being dragged through 
flesh. A pregnant PAUSE and then the sound REPEATS. A briefer 
pause and it REPEATS again.
Peter slowly turns around. His eyes travel up to SEE... ANNIE 
has somehow gotten in. She floats weightlessly in the air. 
(She is faintly illuminated by a candle below her.) She has 
looped the PIANO WIRE around her own NECK, which is already 
straining blood. She TUGS on one end of the wire. It SAWS 
through her neck. She TUGS on the other end of the wire.
It saws even deeper.
PETER
Mommy!
Annie keeps sawing, FASTER and HARDER and with more ruthless 
persistence. The sawing sound is horrible. Peter, screaming, 
TURNS away, only to see:
A MIDDLE-AGED BLONDE MAN, dressed in a red cloak, near Peter.
He’s SMILING giddily. (We will recognize him as the man who 
was smiling at Charlie at Annie’s mother’s funeral.) Behind 
him, two SMILING OLDER WOMEN. They are crouched together, 
illuminated by a nearby candle-flame.
PETER SCREAMS, TURNS, AND RUNS STRAIGHT FOR THE WINDOW. HE 
JUMPS THROUGH THE GLASS.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peter has landed face-first into the SNOW. Small shards of 
glass are embedded all over his body, but nothing too 
serious.
Peter lies motionless for a long time.
129.
We cut WIDE to a BIRD’S EYE VIEW looking down on Peter. He 
lies face-down in the blue-white snow, inanimate. The wind 
blows softly.
We HOLD on this peaceful, static wide. After a moment, a 
SHADOW floats gracefully across the snow. It belongs to 
Annie, who must be above us - but the shadow seems headless.
The shadow drifts out of frame, followed by the vague, 
familiar STREAK OF LIGHT. The light, however, STOPS at Peter.
It dances on his back... steadies... disappears into him.
After a moment, Peter’s head RISES languidly from the snow.
His face is marked by a few minor GASHES (from the glass). He 
looks up, EYES STRANGELY CALM. They even look a bit clouded.
He looks ahead to the TREEHOUSE...
PETER’S POV: Annie’s floating body has arrived at the 
treehouse, which is still glowing by candlelight. She ascends 
into it. For a split-second, before she disappears into the 
treehouse, we see that ANNIE HAS NO HEAD.
Peter rises to his feet, hollow-eyed. His gaze trained on the 
treehouse. He seems to be in some sort of TRANCE - much like 
the trance that Charlie entered earlier. After a moment of 
standing, staring at the treehouse...Peter CLICKS HIS TONGUE.
With that, he begins walking slowly toward the treehouse.
He passes MAX’S DEAD CARCASS, sprawled across a snow-buried 
garden.
As Peter nears the treehouse, he looks up to its OPEN 
WINDOW...
Through the window, from Peter’s low-angle POV: a birdcage 
hangs from the treehouse ceiling. It houses a manic 
WHIPPOORWILL.
We cut to a WIDE of the treehouse as Peter arrives at the 
tree’s base.
Peter pauses. Looks up. After a beat, he begins to leadenly 
climb up.
INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peter, having scaled the tree, pokes his head through the 
floor-hatch and climbs in.
130.
The walls are lined with black candles, and before Peter are 
several MEN AND WOMAN (some elderly, some middle-aged) BOWING 
on their knees, foreheads against the floor. They are all 
dressed in RED CLOAKS.
Standing behind Peter (on the opposite side of the treehouse) 
is the terrible object of their reverence. He turns to see... 
A GIANT, 6’ WOOD-FIGURE MANIKIN. Placed atop its shoulders 
(in lieu of a head) is CHARLIE’S DECAPITATED HEAD - now in an 
advanced state of decomposition. The nose is still smashed 
in, much of the face is black with rot, and it wears a silver 
CROWN. One hand grips a wooden SCEPTER. The manikin’s other 
hand is raised to extend its first two fingers and thumb; the 
third and fourth fingers are bent (like a Christ figure).
Bowing at the foot of the manikin is ANNIE’S HEADLESS TORSO - 
blood pooling at the neck. Beside her corpse, also 
prostrated, is ANNIE’S MOTHER’S HEADLESS CORPSE (still 
dressed in white silk, but in a worse state of decay).
Peter’s eyes are WIDE, but still blank. They are FIXED on 
Charlie’s head. He looks more confused than horrified.
Peter turns around to face the groveling red-cloaked 
worshippers. They now seem to be bowing in his direction.
Among the worshippers is JOAN - her forehead pressed to the 
floor.
Peter, unnerved, looks away. He notices...
A photo portrait of ANNIE’S MOTHER on the wall. She sits 
upright and her expression is severe. The frame bears an 
engraving: “Queen Leigh”
We come to a CLOSE-UP of Peter. He looks confused and scared 
(although not in a way that feels like Peter). We will HOLD 
on this CU for the remainder of the scene.
The sound of someone RISING. This person (Joan) shuffles past 
Peter to lift the crown off of Charlie’s head. She then comes 
to stand (now off-screen) before Peter. After a moment, the 
CROWN enters frame to be placed ceremoniously onto Peter’s 
head.
Peter has TENSED up, desperately avoiding eye contact with 
Joan. He SENSES something behind him. He looks back (and we 
pan-tilt) to see...
The headless corpses of Peter’s family are now inexplicably 
bowing in his direction.
Peter turns forward again - overwhelmed. He looks trapped.
131.
Trembling. His milky eyes are welling with tears.
JOAN (O.S.)
(quietly, trying to 
soothe)
Hey hey - no no - you’re all 
right...
But he is starting to PANIC. His eyes fix fearfully to the 
floor as his breathing grows erratic. Then:
JOAN (O.S.)
Hey: hey: Charlie.
Peter’s breathing HALTS. He looks up to Joan, still 
trembling. Eyes wide.
JOAN
You’re all right now.
A long silence as Peter searches Joan’s face for 
understanding. Peter finally SPEAKS...but he sounds more like 
CHARLIE than Peter.
PETER
Who am I?
A loaded pause from Joan. Then:
JOAN (O.S.)
You are Paimon. One of the eight 
Kings of Hell.
Beat. Peter doesn’t react. He just stares at her, 
uncomprehending.
JOAN (O.S.)
We have looked to the northwest and 
called you in. We’ve corrected your 
first body and give you now this 
healthy male host. We reject the 
Trinity and pray devoutly to you, 
great Paimon: give us your 
knowledge of all secret things and 
all mysteries of the Earth; bring 
us honor, wealth and good 
familiars; and bind all men to our 
Will, as we have bound ourselves 
for now and ever to Yours.
We hear Joan return to her bowing position:
JOAN (O.S.)
Hail Paimon.
132.
Peter’s eyes are buzzing.
Then, from behind Joan:
WORSHIPPERS (O.S.)
Hail Paimon!
Then, louder:
JOAN/WORSHIPPERS (O.S.)
Hail Paimon!!
EXT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

WIDE of the treehouse.
WORSHIPPERS (O.S.)
Hail!!
CUT HARD TO BLACK.
HOLD ON THE BLACK.
From this, we VERY SLOWLY FADE IN ON:
A NEUTRAL WIDE OF THE GRAHAM HOUSE. NIGHT. Surrounded by 
dreamy snowfall. A strong artifice distinguishes the image.
As if the actual house has somehow been replaced by its 
MINIATURE REPLICA. Even the drifting snowflakes look false.
Hold on this as the CREDITS roll.
