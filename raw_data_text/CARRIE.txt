"CARRIE"
FADE IN:
From an absolutely glistening WHITE -- an image which first 
appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe, and then 
gradually becomes more of a piece of solid matter, less of a 
mystery. It's the
EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) - DAY
1
1
FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-
fashioned, spotless — a vision of small town normalcy and 
virtue.
This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. 
It seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is 
white. Even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached. 
Antiseptic.
We hear a woman's voice:
MARGARET (O.S.)
Carrie! Carrie!
The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in 
perspective, through the following prologue, which initially 
involves:
STELLA HORAN - DAY
An All-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the 
tan of her life with only a skimpy white bikini running 
interference between her skin and the sun.
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body — 
luxuriantly, taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs 
in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming from 
a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in 
the Horan back yard.
DOWNWARDS ANGLE - STELLA
as she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at 
her body through the half-grown hedge which separates the 
Horan yard from the White house next door.
VOICE (O.S.)
What are those?
STELLA’S POV - CARRIE WHITE­
2.
A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeter­minate 
age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-white hair which will 
darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, 
however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it is 
these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella through the 
hedge.
STELLA
Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a 
fright.
(turning down the radio)
How long have you been there?
CARRIE
(not smiling; pointing 
with her finger)
What are those?
Stella looks where Carrie is pointing: the top of her bikini 
has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts -- white 
against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit — not out of 
any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being 
stared at so strangely.
STELLA
Those are my breasts, honey.
CARRIE
(a beat; then, solemnly)
I wish I had some.
STELLA
You will. 'Course you’ll have to 
wait a couple of years, but -­
CARRIE
(a fact)
No I won’t.
STELLA
Why, sure you will.
CARRIE
(emphatic)
No I won’t.
(glancing be­ hind her)
Momma says no... Momma says good 
girls don’t.
STELIA
(at something of a loss)
Well, I’m a good girl. And besides, 
doesn’t your mother have breasts?
3.
CARRIE
glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White 
house next door. She swallows her words so that all Stella 
and we hear is:
CARRIE
... dirtypillows.
STELIA
What?
CARRIE
Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says 
she’s got them 'cuz she was bad 
when she made me.
STELLA
Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly 
serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at 
the White house Just beyond the half­ grown hedge.
She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.
STELIA
Now, honey, that's Just silly. 
Listen — you must be real hot in 
that long dress. What do you say we 
go inside and get us some lemonade, 
would you like that?
CARRIE
clearly torn -- tempted but in the clutch of some weird 
terror — as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her 
up. She shakes her head.
STELIA
C’mon.
(offering her hand)
It'll be our secret.
Carrie — now really scared -- shakes her head and disappears 
farther into the hedge.
CARRIE
I can’t!
STELIA
Sure you can. I make it nice and 
sweet, and —
4.
And Just at that moment, a figure appears in a second-story 
window in the White House. Although Stella and we really 
can’t see distinctly through the sun’s glare it’s 
unmistakably MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees 
her daughter with Stella, she lets out a bloodcurdling 
scream:
MARGARET
CAARRIEETTAAA!!!
CARRIE, STELLA
Both frozen by this terrible sound.
STELLA’S POV - CLOSER ON CARRIE
as she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as 
if she might faint. She looks quickly to Stella, then back at 
the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, 
she seems to smile — or is she about to cry?
And then, she’s gone — running around the hedge and then up 
the porch stairs and into the White house as fast as her legs 
can carry her.
STELLA
stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to 
do. It's utterly silent for a moment.
And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts 
coming from the White house — an unearthly babble as Margaret 
White screams, rants, and screeches as Carrie sobs that she’s 
sorry, that she forgot.
STELIA
Mother!
(louder)
Mother!
THE HORAN HOUSE
as MRS. HORAN — in an old housedress with the hem falling 
down the back — rushes out in answer to her daughter’s call.
-
MRS. HORAN
What in the name of God? What' s 
the matter?
STELLA
(frantic)
5.
I don’t know... Carrie was just 
talking to me, and Mrs. White 
started screaming and...
THE WHITE HOUSE
The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. 
Again, it should appear like a huge glass globe over which we 
counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less 
distinct babble of another:
MARGARET (V.O.)
I told you to stay away from there, 
I told you...
CARRIE (V.O.)
I’m sorry, Momma.
MARGARET (V.O.)
..to stay away from that girl, that 
whore...
CARRIE (V.O.)
Please, Momma!
MARGARET (V.O.)
... of Babylon!
which continues over:
TWO SHOT - STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
Their eyes riveted on the house — trying, squinting to see 
through the sun's terrible glare.
STELLA
Don’t you yell at her like that! 
Stop that!
MRS. HORAN
That poor sweet child...
STELLA
Mother, we've got to do something!
MRS. HORAN
What?
STELLA
Call the police? Mother, call the 
police!
MRS. HORAN
6.
(not about to interfere; 
hope­ less)
The-child...
At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its cres­cendo; we 
should be able to pick out phrases in this cacophony as 
Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for 
forgiveness; as Carrie’s fright­ened little voice proclaims 
that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then suddenly, the 
screaming stops and it's quiet — dead quiet.
THE WHITE HOUSE
as it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING 
SOUND, and then what appears to be a stone the size of a 
small pebble lands on the roof.
Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. 
And then another, and another, and...
TIGHTER TWO SHOT - STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like 
marbles...
THE WHITE HOUSE
as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones — 
WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air like miniature bombs.
Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.
Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.
One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. 
CRASHING, CRACKING SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear 
into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.
The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.
TWO SHOT - MRS. HORAN AND STELLA
Frozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, 
her screams blending with the SOUND of larger and larger 
stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout 
screaming:
MARGARET’S VOICE
Stop that! Stop that!
Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the 
freakiest of summer storms — a healthy young woman as her 
figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this 
nightmarish moment.
7.
THE HOUSE
as still larger stones hail from the sky.
And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they began, 
just as incredibly as they started, they stop.
TWO SHOT - THE WOMEN
Mrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter 
standing next to her, transfixed on the lawn. Once again, 
it’s quiet.
THE WHITE HOUSE
as one final stone — this one the size of a mere pebble, a 
small mothball — falls from the roof and plops onto the lawn.
The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to 
bleach out, turning the screen once again into an incredible, 
silently blazing white.
As the colors bleach out, we go directly into the
MAIN TITLES.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

Now some years later — and no longer glistening so whitely or 
mysteriously. We see the front of the house as the door flies 
open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the 
doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the 
porch, the screen door bangs behind her.
She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress — much too long, not 
so much out of style as utterly without style.
What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the 
pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable 
eyes.
As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:
MARGARET'S VOICE
Carrie!
Carrie stops, turns to reply, into the house.
CARRIE
Yes, Momma.
MARGARET’S VOICE
8.
You come straight home from school.
A moment of hesitation on Carrie’s part, a very slight hint 
of rebellion. But:
CARRIE
(sweetly)
I always do, Momma.
Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, 
quickening.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE

As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the 
sidewalk, in the course of which she passes by where the 
Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No 
one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, 
with overgrown weeds. From the looks of them, the house 
vanished a long time ago.
EXT. TOWN STREETS - DAY

Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above 
her. The farther she gets from her house, the livelier she 
seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl 
pushing out, an altogether different creature than her 
appearance would suggest.
And to help persuade us about this possibility, there is 
MUSIC.
BOBBY ERBETER
about five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the 
streets, keeping pace with Carrie on a twenty­ inch Schwinn 
with training wheels.
BOBBY
Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying 
Carrie! Praying Carrie, praying 
Carrie, praying Carrie...
Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on 
toward the high school, in the background.
Bobby, frustrated, stops, astride his bike and screams after 
her.
Bobby’s face —

THE FACE OF AN ADOLESCENT
or as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is patheti­cally 
thin, myopic, weak-chinned, beak-nosed — almost a caricature 
of an adolescent reject. Over his face, we HEAR:
FROMM'S VOICE
What are you going to leave for us, 
You people in your big cars Spewing 
pollution into the air?
We PAN the faces of adolescents, listening with various 
degrees of attention, indifference, or reluctance to:
FROMM'S VOICE
You people with heavy feet 
Trampling down the wilderness? You 
people who peer into the back
seats of our cars
Hours after you come out of the
back doors of your motels.
Soon all we will have is each 
other, And that could be enough...
INT. CLASSROOM - FROMM - DAY

or, as he is known to his pupils, BIG BELLY FROMM, at his 
desk in front of the class, reading from an assignment paper.
FROMM
... If you will let us have room
enough
And air enough And peace enough To 
love each other As you never could.
He sets down the paper, and looks at the class.
FROMM’S POV - THE CLASS
We will see, among the others, Carrie.
We also see TOMMY ROSS - a mid-seventies version of the boy 
next door. Good-looking, clean-cut, intelligent, athletic.
FROMM
He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of 
puzzlement.
FROMM
I must say -- I must confess — this 
poem displays an extraordinary 
talent...
10.
(the knife)
... a talent extraordinary for you, 
Tommy Ross.
THE CLASS
All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed.
In fact, he turns, clasps his hands over his head, to the 
delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he 
is a goof-off; he is a kid aware of his own popularity and 
comfortable with it.
FROMM
FROMM
Tommy, this is slightly different 
from running for a touchdown... Any 
criticisms?
THE CLASS
The usual hesitation. Then Carrie’s hand shoots up.
FROMM
He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, 
volunteering.
FROMM
Carrie White?
THE CLASS - FEATURING CARRIE
Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck 
with it. The eyes of the class are on her. And she has to say 
something. So she does.
CARRIE
It’s... beautiful.
FROMM
He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seem­ing to 
pounce on Carrie.
FROMM
'Beautiful.' 'Bee-t-ti-ful!' 'Oh, 
beautiful for spacious skies, for 
amber waves of grain.' Is that the 
beautiful you mean?
11.
The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance 
toward Tommy. Tommy looks at her, and away, embarrassed. 
Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.
FROMM
That isn’t exactly criticism, Miss 
White.
(looking around)
Anyone else?
(no one else)
Well, at least we’ve finally gotten 
Carrie White to say something!
Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting 
compassion. Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering 
something. Or to be specific:
TOMMY
(muttering)
You suck.
FROMM
Tommy? You said something?
TOMMY
Yes sir.
(moment; "popular" grin)
I said... 'shucks.’
But everyone in the class knows.
CUT TO:
A VOLLEYBALL
arching over the net, striking the outstretched hands of 
CHRIS HARGENSEN, a girl of seventeen loaded with sexual 
dynamite (which could explode later in life into a husband, 
three children and numerous little affairs).
Chris skillfully passes the ball to a girl with the clean 
good looks of a cheerleader, SUE SNELL; she hits it back over 
the net. One of their teammates is Carrie, but Carrie is 
placed off in a corner, safely distant from the main action, 
awkward, tentative, wanting to get into the game, afraid of 
making a mis­take.
The game is supervised by MISS COLLINS, about 24, wearing gym 
shorts which show her good legs, and a tee-shirt which shows 
very little. She’s in her second year of teaching.
The serve goes to Carrie’s team.
CHRIS
12.
Whose serve?
SUE
Carrie’s.
CHRIS
(groaning)
Oh, Gawwwd!
The groan is taken up by all the girls, becoming a chorus as 
the ball is thrown to Carrie, who fumbles it before stepping 
to the service line.
RHONDA
Don’t hit it into the net!
EXT - A VOLLEYBALL COURT - DAY

Two teams of girls among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, 
CORA and RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical 
twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE SNELL. Supervising the game 
is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm up suit and holding a whistle 
awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously 
watching for the ball to come her way.
It has apparently been a close game the competition building 
steadily. When the shot begins Miss Collins has just blown 
her whistle to announce:
COLLINS
Okay, now. This is game point.
This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is 
serving (she is on the opposite team as Carrie).
RHONDA
(giving the score)
Twenty - Twenty.
The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some 
time as the girls skillfully volley it back and forth over 
the net. And then, just when the tension is greatest, the 
ball comes over the net toward Carrie.
It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her 
success. The little boy who. decided to put his fin­ger in the 
dyke had it easier.
The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and ad­ 
monitions to Carrie. Carrie almost trembles with ten­sion, 
about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.
13.
Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line—
straight into the net.
Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you 
know!" and "Dumbo!" reinforcing them. The game is obviously 
over and the girls begin to file off the court and move 
toward the locker room. Just as Chris passes the humiliated 
Carrie:
CHRIS
(low, harsh)
You eat shit!
CUT TO:
Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler 
and cavort under individual showers. They banter little 
barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family 
plaints, talk of college - all of which we hear from separate 
stalls. One by one the showers are turned off, the girls 
stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps, toweling, 
spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. 
Steam hangs in the air. So do words, running into one 
another, tumbling, drifting.
‘...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister’s husband picks 
his nose... So does your sister... too cheap to spend a 
penny... we’ll go after school... I’m going with Billy, we’ll 
meet you... Friday night...’
We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies 
Carrie still standing under the shower. She claps her hands 
once, smartly.
COLLINS
What are you waiting for, Carrie?
(as Carrie looks at her)
Bell in five minutes.
CARRIE
Oh uh?
As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward 
their lockers, Carrie is left alone in her shower stall. She 
is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her 
shoulders, moving her hands over her breasts in small, 
regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes out of 
frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame 
— full of blood. And just as she and we see this, so do the 
girls.
CHRIS
Peer-iod! Peer-iod!
14.
Carrie stares at her dumbly.
The other girls are quick to take up the chant. Chris leads 
them.
GIRLS
Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-
iod!
One voice chimes in:
NORMA
Plug it up!
Others take up this new chant. For a while, like 
counterpoint, the chants overlap; then the new chant emerges 
solely:
GIRLS
Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!
Dime-sized drops are striking the tile floor at Carrie's 
feet.
SUE
For God’s sake, Carrie, you got 
your period.
(as Carrie turns toward 
her)
Clean yourself up!
Carrie seems bewildered.
15-
SUE
(furiously)
You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, 
you're bleeding!
Carrie looks down and walls; the sound is very loud.
A tampon strikes Carrie's chest, plops to her feet.
Carrie just stares at it..
NORMA
She thinks they're for lipstick.
Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up.
Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie.
15.
Another. The girls are bombarding her with tampons and 
sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken 
dispenser on the wall. As they bombard Carrie:
GIRLS
Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, 
plug it up...
We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, 
and watch her beginning to be caught-up in what can only be 
described as a fury.
Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and 
louder.
The door is flung open by Collins.
COLLINS
What is this?
And she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, 
blows and blows! The sound is louder than a shriek (which it 
resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't).
And there is sudden silence.
COLLINS
(to girls)
Get out! Get out!
The girls retreat, Sue last.
SUE
It must be her first...
COLLINS
Out!
As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has 
backed up and is whimpering. Collins slaps her face, not too 
hard at first, then with a flash of anger.
CARRIE
M... M... Miss Collins...
COLLINS
Stand up. Take care of yourself.
CARRIE
I’m bleeding.
One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins’ white 
shorts, leaving a bloody handprint.
16.
COLLINS
Damn you!
She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken 
sanitary napkin dispenser.
COLLINS
Get over there! And take one!
CARRIE
I don’t know...
COLLINS
Never mind the coin slot... it’s 
broken.
CARRIE
It hurts... my stomach...
COLLINS
(grabbing her)
Do it! Now.
CARRIE
I can’t. I don't know how!
There’s a bright flash as a light BULB POPS, fizzling out. 
Collins is surprised.
COLLINS
What...?
And she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away. Her 
voice softens.
COLLINS
Carrie, don’t you know...?
(shakes her head; 
realizing and wondering)
You don’t.
(reaches for Carrie)
I’ll show you.

HENRY MORTON, the principal, a decent but somewhat plodding 
man in his mid-forties, is tapping out his pipe as he talks 
to Collins.
MORTON
Isn’t she a bit old for her...
Well, he can’t quite say it.
COLLINS
Her first period?
MORTON
Ah, yes.
COLLINS
Morty, until a half hour ago, I 
don’t think she knew there was such 
a thing.
He hesitates a moment -- noticing Carrie’s bloody handprint 
on Collins’ gym shorts.
MORTON
It’s hard to believe in this day 
and age a girl in high school 
wouldn’t know... something... the 
facts.
COLLINS
Well, knowing that mother of 
hers...
MORTON
(cutting her off)
Miss Collins, if you’d been with us 
longer, you'd understand we cannot 
interfere with people's beliefs. As 
for the girls —
COLLINS
Carrie's always been their 
scapegoat. So they...
MORTON
You’ll have to do something.
COLLINS
I will. But I understood how those 
girls felt. The whole thing just 
made me want to take the girl and 
shake her.
MORTON
18.
Ummm.
COLLINS
It's just her period for God's 
sake.
MORTON
(cutting in; 
uncomfortable)
We’ll send her home.

Miss Finch send in Cassie Wright.
COLLINS
It’s Carrie White.
MORTON
(fiddling with paper 
clips on his desk)
Oh.
The door is opened. Carrie stands in the doorway.
MORTON
Come in, Cassie.
Collins starts to correct him, but:
MORTON
Close the door. No, wait.

Miss Finch bring in a dismissal s 
lip.
(to Carrie)
I think you might take the rest of 
the day and go home and, uh, 
well... take care of yourself, 
Cassie.
CARRIE
(hardly a murmur)
Carrie.
MORTON
We’re all sorry about this 
incident.
MISS FINCH elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow 
dismissal slip, brings it to Morton, who initials it.
MORTON
(to Fish, as she goes)
Thank you.
(to Carrie)
19.
Would you like to go to the 
infirmary?...
Carrie is shaking her head.
MORTON
... lie down for a while...
COLLINS
I think Carrie can go home.
MORTON
Would you like a ride?
Again Carrie is shaking her head.
MORTON
We could call you a cab.
COLLINS
I’m sure she can walk home. And 
Carrie, you’re excused from gym for 
a week. Take study hall instead.
Morton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to Carrie.
MORTON
We are sorry about this, Cassie.
CARRIE
(sudden fury)
That’s not my name!
Two things happen simultaneously: Morton recoils slightly and 
the ashtray quakes a little and then tumbles from the desk.
Then Carrie goes out.
Morton conies around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, 
stares at it curiously for a moment, then looks at Collins.
COLLINS
(slowly)
That reminds me. A light blew out 
while I was trying to calm her 
down.
MORTON
I'll send a janitor to fix it.
Okay, that's reality. He puts the ashtray back on the desk 
decisively, dismissing any "peculiar" thought he may have 
had.

preparing dinner; in her line of sight a television game show 
glitters.

Eleanor frowns momentarily, leave the kitchen.

Through the middleclass, rather tasteful home, to the front 
door.

Eleanor opens the door.
ANGLE ON MARGARET WHITE
standing in the doorway. She is a large lady dressed in 
black, carrying a worn black leather sack, which we will 
discover is bulging with religious tracts.
ELEANOR, WITH MARGARET
Margaret White is not a welcome visitor, but Eleanor Snell is 
a polite lady.
ELEANOR
Oh, Mrs. White.
MARGARET
How have you been, Mrs. Snell?
ELEANOR
Fine.
MARGARET
And the doctor?
ELEANOR
Fine.
MARGARET
And your daughter?
ELEANOR
Sue is ... fine.
An impasse. Finally Eleanor feels constrained to open the 
door wider, put a little smile on her face, and:
ELEANOR
Won’t you come in, Mrs. White?
MARGARET
Thank you.
She steps inside, and Eleanor closes the door behind her, 
saying:
ELEANOR
I think Carrie is in some of Sue’s 
classes.
MARGARET
Yes .
ELEANOR
24.
Perhaps some time Carrie might 
visit...
MARGARET
I’m here on the Lord’s work.
ELEANOR
Yes. Of course.
Margaret is fishing tracts out of her bag.
MARGARET
These will interest the doctor and 
you.
Eleanor looks at the tracts with pretended Interest.
ELEANOR
I’m sure they will.
MARGARET
And your daughter.
ELEANOR
(a smile)
Well, I don’t think Sue would be —
MARGARET
(cutting in)
Children are godless these days, 
Mrs. Snell.
Margaret’s voice is almost toneless — now and throughout.
ELEANOR
My Sue is a good girl.
MARGARET
These are godless times.
. ELEANOR
I’ll drink to that.
Humor -- and she regrets it immediately.
ELEANOR
(continuing; quietly)
We’ll all read... these.
The telephone RINGS.
ELEANOR
(continuing; relief)
Excuse me.

(retreating)
Please sit down.
Margaret doesn't sit, and Eleanor flees into the kitchen.

As Eleanor reaches the phone.
ELEANOR
Hello... Betty, can I call you 
back. Margaret White is here... 
Right... right... Let me get rid of 
her and I’ll call you back.
She hangs up, opens a drawer, takes out some hidden household 
money (a couple of bills), and drags her­ self back into the 
living, room.
INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM - DAY

Margaret is still where we left her.
ELEANOR
We’d like to contribute ten...
(a look at Margaret)
... twenty dollars.
MARGARET
Thank you. I’ll give you a receipt.
Eleanor shifts from foot to foot while Margaret writes out 
the receipt, gives it to her.
ELEANOR
Thank you, Mrs. White.
MARGARET
I’ll pray you find Jesus before 
it’s too late.
What can one say? Eleanor stands there, completely 
exasperated but retaining her politeness like a steel, 
middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and 
the latter leaves. Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, 
seeing:
EXT. SNELL HOUSE - FROM DOOR - DAY

26.
Sue is coming toward the door. She passes Margaret with a 
quick (inaudible) greeting and hurries to the front door 
where her mother is waiting.
SUE
That's Carrie White's mother...
As Eleanor nods and closes the door.
SUE
(apprehensively)
What did she want?
ELEANOR
(indicating tracts)
She gave us these —
(conspiratorial sigh)
— and I gave her a donation.
Sue's face betrays relief; but Eleanor notices nothing
ELEANOR
(brightly)
Well, how was school today?
SUE
Today? Like always.
HOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps 
out the window as Margaret leaves). A long beat, then:
DISSOLVE TO:
CARRIE
Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her 
room which overlooks the street. She is wear­ing Just a slip 
or perhaps an old terrycloth robe — her plain dress and 
school books on the narrow bed.
She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of 
"Seventeen" — absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in 
their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men. An 
escape of sorts.
And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White 
house: tiny, plain, severe. It's decorated with Just the 
fewest embellishments (i.e., a high school pennant) that 
Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices — a 
crucifix above Carrie’s bed, a small bureau with an equally 
small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna 
and Child, and various religious prints and plaster 
quotations on the wall.
27.
ANGLE - FEATURING CARRIE
Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female 
fantasies courtesy of the slick Madison Avenue mind. And 
then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that 
fears it's about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, 
Carrie glances out the window and down to see:
EXT. THE STREET - MARGARET
16
16
as this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. 
Another woman dressed like this would be coming home from a 
funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.
CLOSEUP - CARRIE
her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we 
witnessed earlier — a scared little girl now encased in the 
body of an adolescent.
As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her 
name as she hangs up her coat, Carrie hastily stashes the 
magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we 
hear the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her 
daily afternoon ritual of making tea.
And then the telephone RINGS — only to stop as Margaret picks 
up the receiver. It’s just as Carrie dreaded -- it’s the 
school — and she stands by the door, trying desperately to 
overhear Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs- 
up, and in a deadly tone of voice — not yelling but 
enunciating with terrible clarity — she calls up the stairs:
MARGARET'S VOICE
I know you're listening. Come 
downstairs.
And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:
HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM - FOLLOWING CARRIE
as she hurries down toward her mother and into:
INT. WHITE KITCHEN - DAY

Where Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in 
stony silence.
CARRIE
Hello, Momma.
28.
No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the 
gas burner, and in this altogether strange little kitchen — a 
veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art -- Margaret is 
a rock.
Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame 
and the need to talk. Yet she recognizes her mother’s wall of 
silence, knowing she won't speak until she’s ready. They’ve 
been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie 
breaks.
CARRIE
Who was it that called?
(no response)
What did they say?
MARGARET
point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn’t respond 
immediately. Then she turns from the stove.
MARGARET
(softly)
You're a woman now.
CARRIE
Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me 
something? I was so scared...
Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She 
puts on rimless glasses, then opens the Bible and starts to 
read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her 
face:
MARGARET
'And God made Eve from the rib of 
Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed 
the raven on the world, and the 
raven was called Sin — ’
She pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place.
MARGARET
... and the raven was called Sin...
CARRIE
Why didn’t you tell me? Oh, Momma —
MARGARET
(overriding)
... and the raven was called Sin... 
Sin!... and the first sin was 
intercourse.
29.
CARRIE
I was so scared! And the other 
girls, they made fun of me and 
threw things and -­
Margaret’s hand flashes out-backhanding Carrie into the wall. 
It's a wallop of a slap, the sting of it bringing tears to 
her eyes.
CARRIE
Momma, please listen. It wasn't my 
fault.
Another backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor.
CARRIE
Momma!
MARGARET
And Eve was weak and... say it, 
woman!
CARRIE
No, Momma.
MARGARET
Say it!
Kick.
CARRIE
Momma, please help me.
MARGARET
And Eve was weak and loosed the 
raven on the world.
CARRIE
They threw things...
MARGARET
(overriding)
... and the raven was called Sin... 
Sin!... and the first sin was 
intercourse.
CARRIE
Momma, please listen.
A kick.
MARGARET
30.
And the Lord visited Eve with a 
Curse, and the Curse was the Curse 
of Blood!
The teakettle starts to WHISTLE.
CARRIE
You should have told, me!
Margaret clutches Carrie’s wrist in a vise.
MARGARET
(heavenward)
O Lord, help this sinning woman see 
the sin of her days and ways. Show 
her that if she had remained 
sinless —
CARRIE
No!
MARGARET
— the Curse of Blood would never 
have come on her. She may have been 
tempted by the Antichrist. She may 
have committed the Sin of Lustful 
Thoughts —
The teakettle is WHISTLING louder — a high-pitched scream.
CARRIE
No, Momma.
MARGARET
Don’t you lie to me, Carietta, 
don’t you know by now I can see 
inside you? I can see your sin just 
as surely as God can.
CARRIE
Momma, let me go.
Margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet.
MARGARET
We will pray. We will pray, woman, 
we will pray to Jesus for our 
woman-weak, wicked, sinning 
souls...
She switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, 
rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an ominous blue light. A 
vision of a wrathful God. Throughout the following, Carrie 
struggles desperately, but she's no match for her mother.
31.
MARGARET
And the Lord visited Eve with a 
Curse, and the Curse was the Curse 
of Blood. And there was a Second 
Curse, and this was the Curse of 
Childbearing, and Eve brought forth 
Cain in sweat and blood!
She propels Carrie into the closet, slams the door behind 
her. Margaret's voice continues, overlapping onto:
INT. CLOSET - CARRIE - DAY

very much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of 
the closet — crying, disheveled, beaten. The closet is just 
what every child ever dreaded about the night.
JESUS
looking down at Carrie.
CARRIE
She looks away — and inwards. With her, we see:
SPLATS OF BLOOD
falling on the shower floor.
THE GIRLS - IN THE SHOWER ROOM
surrounding Carrie, jeering her, bombarding her.
JESUS
impassive, impersonal, unconcerned — or so it seems.
CHRIS - IN THE SHOWER ROOM
in the forefront of the pack.
CARRIE - IN THE SHOWER ROOM
as the girls would see her, cowering, the bloody napkins 
pelting her.
JESUS - CLOSER ANGLE
the blood seems to be streaming down his face; it moves.
CARRIE - IN THE CLOSET
tears are streaming down her face. She whispers:

CARRIE
Please!
Carrie closes her eyes. Overlapping music (perhaps David 
Bowie's "Changes" - the sax break) begins, and
The SCREEN GOES DARK.

MOVING IN SLOWLY on Tommy Ross' 1963 Ford, which is parked in 
shadows on The Hill (something of a ridge which overlooks the 
town and is dedicated to Eros by high school students and 
occasional graduates).
The MUSIC swells as we MOVE IN. And finally, we PEER into the 
car, where we SEE:
INT. TOMMY'S FORD - NIGHT
20

Sue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat. 
They are both putting their clothes in order, silently, 
slowly.
Then they climb into the front seat. Sue takes out a 
cigarette. Tommy lights it with the dashboard lighter. They 
say nothing as Sue smokes for a few moments. Then Tommy looks 
at her closely.
TOMMY
Hey.
She turns away.
TOMMY
Hey, what’s the matter?
He puts his arm around her clumsily.
SUE
Nothing.
TOMMY
What did I do?
SUE
Nothing. It's not you.
TOMMY
33.
Hey, everything's all right. I love 
you, honey.
(silence)
Did I...?
SUE
(blurting)
It’s Carrie.
TOMMY
Who?
SUE
Carrie. Carrie White.
TOMMY
Praying Carrie?
SUE
(sharply)
Don't call her that.
TOMMY
(imitating Carrie)
It's... beautiful.
(laughing)
That's what she said when I read 
that poem you wrote for me.
SUE
Tommy, please...
TOMMY
(going on)
And Big Belly Fromm saying...
(imitating)
That isn't exactly criticism, Miss 
White.
(exploding)
Jesus!
Sue has turned away from him.
TOMMY
Hey, honey, it was a beautiful 
poem. I wish I could have written 
it.
(silence)
Honey?
SUE
Don’t call me that.
TOMMY
34.
Don't call her that. Don't call me 
that. What the hell's the matter 
with you?
She is crying, that's what.
TOMMY
Hey, are you crying?
(yes, stupid)
Are you?
He tries to turn her toward him. She struggles. Man­ fully, he 
forces her around.
TOMMY
Jesus, Sue. What is it?
SUE
(trying to turn away)
I told you.
TOMMY
Told me what?
SUE
About Carrie.
TOMMY
That thing in the shower?
(she's silent)
Hey, it was a Joke, wasn't it? I 
mean everyone was doing it.
SUE
I'm not everyone.
TOMMY
You're special.
SUE
I was one of them.
TOMMY
So you were teasing Carrie White -­
SUE
We were hurting her --
TOMMY
35.
She's used to it. Jesus, you 
remember how she’d get down on her 
knees and say grace in the 
cafeteria... alone, for Christ1s 
sake. And the way she dresses... 
Hey, Sue, she’s asking for it.
SUE
(vehemently)
How would you like to be Carrie 
White?
TOMMY
How would I like to be Carrie 
White?
SUE
How would you like to be Carrie 
White? How would you like to be 
Carrie White instead of being Tommy 
Ross... big man, big jock, popular.
TOMMY
What's the big deal about being 
popular? I mean, one day I'll wake 
up and find myself working at my 
dad's car lot and out Friday nights 
and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or 
the Cavalier drinking beer and 
maybe married with a bunch of 
kids...
(stops)
What's that got to do with Carrie 
White? Or anything?
SUE
I did something wrong and I feel 
bad about it.
TOMMY
I can understand that. Hey, back in 
seventh grade there was this kid...
SUE
(interrupting)
I've got to do something about it.
TOMMY
Like what?
SUE
I don't know yet. Apologize.
TOMMY
36.
Okay, you tell her you’re sorry.
SUE
That’s not enough. That's like 
something my mom would do.
TOMMY
What are you going to do? Kiss her, 
for God’s sake?
SUE
God, I hate you sometimes!
TOMMY
What the hell do you want me to do?
SUE
I want you to help me. Or are you 
just interested in fucking me?
TOMMY
(angrily)
Don't say that!
SUE
Fucking me, fucking me...
TOMMY
Cut it out!
SUE
Then help me!
Tommy moves back from Sue. He is looking at her, try­ ing to 
figure her out. He wants to do something, he doesn't want an 
argument, but...
TOMMY
Okay. What can I do?
SUE
I want you to think about Carrie 
White.
TOMMY
(incredulously)
You want me-to sit here and think 
about... Jesus!
(moment)
Are you serious?
(moment)
You're serious.
(moment)
What's there to think about?
37.
SUE
Think ab out it.
TOMMY
Jesus.
He stares off through the windshield. He is really-puzzled. 
He steals a look at Sue. He starts to put his arm around her; 
she moves a little, subtly but clearly. Tommy stares off into 
space again.
TOMMY
I never thought about her. I mean, 
she wasn’t someone you had to think 
about.
(beat)
She was always there — keeping to 
herself in that stupid dress and 
that weird mother.
(beat)
You know what I mean?
Sue glances toward him. Of course she knows. And he is 
beginning to understand.
Tommy looks straight ahead again. He is starting to think. 
It's not all that easy.
TOMMY
(almost under his breath)
Carrie White?
It does come out as a question.
DISSOLVE TO:

Margaret is at the sewing machine. She is either listening to 
a reasonable facsimile of Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the 
radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays Tennessee 
Ernie Ford's "Let the Lower Lights Be Burning." A Black 
Forest cuckoo clock, providing a sense of lapsed time.
Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself. 
The needle begins to dip up and down; the bobbin whirs and 
jerks.
Margaret turns around to see:
CARRIE
She is standing in the entrance of the living room.
38.
Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm, almost too calm.
MARGARET
A touch of fear in her eyes. But:
MARGARET
Go to bed.
CARRIE
She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the

CARRIE
Good night, Momma.
Carrie goes to the stairs.

Carrie goes into her room.
INT. CARRIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Carrie turns on a light. She undresses slowly, wearily. And 
then she stops and looks at herself in the mirror. A close, 
tired inspection. Her eyes seem hollow, haunted. Carrie 
doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself.
Flex. Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs.
Flex. The mirror cracks wider.
And flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in 
pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall on the floor.
MARGARET'S VOICE
Carrie! Carrie? Carrie!
A moment of utter panic -- now what?
HALLWAY STAIRS
as Margaret strides up them, past the landing, and tries the 
knob on Carrie's door. It's locked. She rattles the knob. But 
to no avail. Then:
MARGARET
39.
Carrie! Carrie, open this door!
(a beat; nothing)
Carrie!
Another beat; then:
CARRIE'S VOICE
(sweetly)
It's open, Momma.
Margaret tries the knob again, and it is, indeed, open.
INT. CARRIE’S ROOM

where Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel 
nightgown, praying.
MARGARET
What was that noise?
CARRIE
Nothing, Momma.
Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, 
no mistake about it. But there it is -- whole again as her 
reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, 
rearranges the plastic-glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on 
the dresser.
MARGARET
Go to bed.
She leaves the doorway, and we return to Carrie who smiles 
sweetly. And then:
Flex.
The door slams closed.

COLLINS
Okay. I just want you all to know

HELEN SHYRES
the freckled, slightly pudgy girl sitting next to Sue -- 
giggles nervously. But no one joins her, and she claps her 
hand over her mouth, trying to stifle it.
COLLINS
glaring at Helen, silencing her.
COLLINS
Did any of you stop to think that 
Carrie White has feelings? Do any 
of you ever stop to think? No, I 
guess you've got your minds on your 
dates and the Prom. Chris, I 
imagine you can take your pick, 
who's the lucky guy?
CHRIS

Billy Nolan.
COLLINS

Who? Speak up! I can't hear you.
Chris tries to control her anger -- is barely able to.
CHRIS
Billy Nolan.

Collins eye-to-eye with Chris now, smiles.
COLLINS
Well, isn't he the lucky one.
She walks down the line, stopping in front of Sue.
COLLINS
And what about you, Sue? Who's 
taking you?
SUE
Tommy Ross.
COLLINS
Right.
(beat, then)
Okay. Now my idea for this little 
trick you pulled was three days' 
suspension and refusal of your prom 
tickets.
THE GIRLS

SUE'S POV - COLLINS
almost seeming to single Sue out as she continues -­ at least 
that's the way it seems to Sue.
COLLINS
That would hit you where you live, 
now, wouldn't it? And you'd deserve 
it -- I don't think any of you have 
any idea of just how nasty what you 
did was. The office has decided 
you're to have one week's 
detention.
The girls sigh with relief; Chris has a particularly smug 
look. Collins takes in their reactions; then she reels in the 
line:
COLLINS
But. There's one little catch. It's 
to be my detention.
COLLINS
Right here in the gym. Fifty 
minutes every day. Get the picture?

CHRIS
I won’t come.
COLLINS

COLLINS
That's up to you, Chris. That's up

skipping detention is three days' 
suspension and the loss of your 
prom tickets. Any other thoughts?

CUT TO:
AN INDEX CARD - SCHOOL LIBRARY
And then another, and another, and yet another flip­ ping by 
us, one title following another as Carrie looms over the card 
catalog, searching. The title cards include POISON, POLITICS 
and POLTERGEISTS -­ on this latter card, it reads: "A ghost 
supposed to be responsible for table rappings and other 
mysterious noisy disturbances." It also contains a cross-
reference — see tele — and the rest of the word is blurred.

Hey, Sue! Just who I've been 
looking for.
Sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile.
Chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her 
John F. Kennedy school yearbook across the table — an action 
which Sue involuntarily Jerks away from out of nervousness..
CHRIS
(continuing)
47.
I wanted you to sign my yearbook. 
Hey, where's your old man, did he 
stand you up?
SUE
(busying herself with the 
year­ book)
Still at practice.
CHRIS
Well, I guess you've heard I'm out 
of the prom. I bet that cocksucker 
Morton loses his Job, though. 
Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! 
Billed I Come over and say hi to 
Sue.
Sue slides the yearbook back across the table to Chris who 
examines it:
CHRIS
(continuing)
Hey, is that it? Just Sue Snell?
Billy goons INTO FRAME next to Chris, glomming his arm around 
her neck.
BILLY
Hi, Suze.
CHRIS
I think we're going anyway, right, 
Billee?
BILLY
Sure thing, Charlie.
Chris playfully Jabs him in the ribs.
SUE
You mean crash?
(UUKTINUKD)
CHRIS
Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I’ve 
got a good one. 'Roses are red, 
violets are blue, sugar is sweet, 
but Carrie White eats shit!
Billy, goon that he is, cracks up.
Sue finds it not at all funny, but doesn't know exactly what 
to do about what she's feeling.
48.
SUE
Chris, I've got to go.
A new tune comes on the Juke — Shirley and Company whooping 
it up on "SHAME, SHAME, SHAME."
CHRIS
(oblivious; her laughter 
turn­ing to fury)
That goddamn Carrie! If only the 
rest of you had walked out with 
me... Jesus, Sue, why didn't you?
SUE
I took the detention because I 
thought we — — earned it. It was a 
shitty thing to have done. End of 
statement.
CHRIS
Bullshit! That goddamn nerd and her 
batshit mother — saying we’re all 
going to hell.
SUE
(rising)
What'd she ever do to you, Chris? 
Or to any of us? Why do you hate 
her so much?
CHRIS
Hey, hey... tell me if I'm wrong, 
but who was that in there pitching 
with the rest of us?
SUE
Me.
(it comes out a pinched 
nerve)
Me. But I stopped.
50,
CHRIS
(dawning on her; getting 
it finally)
Oh. Oh, aren't you Just it? Oh ray, 
yes.
(imitating, prissy)
You stopped. Hey, Billee, she 
stopped.
49.
Sue is scared now — she hears it coming. There's no question 
about it, though; the rumbles have al­ ready begun, and 
there's no stopping what’s coming.
CHRIS
(continuing)
God, I’m dumb sometimes. Billee, 
hey, Billee, you want to know why 
Suze here didn't walk out?
Billy's over by the pinball machines with some of his goon 
squad. He boastfully struts around — much to their obvious 
delight — making the sound of a chicken in reply.
SUE - CLOSE
seeing this; feeling it all about to lurch out of control and 
turn against her. The bottom's fall­ing out.
SUE
I'll see you around, Chris.
TWO SHOT - SUE AND CHRIS
FEATURING Chris prominently — a bloodhound now sure of the 
scent:
CHRIS
No. Wait. You stopped, remember? So 
Just stop again.
(uglier)
Why didn’t you walk out? Why didn’t 
you walk out, Sue?
SUE
Okay, Chris. That’s enough.
CHRIS
You didn't walk out, Sue... little 
Suze... little Suzy Creamcheese... 
because you didn't want to miss a 
moment of your precious prom.
Bulls-eye. Sue fights back tears and fury, trembling now. But 
she tries to muster up some dignity.
SUE
And you don't?
CHRIS
(not about to be put off)
You're goddamn fight, I don't. But 
we're on your case now.
(beat)
50.
I'll bet you've got your dress all 
picked out, too. What color is it? 
Yellowguts?
Sue's about to break, holding it in as best she can.
Chris just as quickly as she spots the weakness, shuts it 
off, bottling up all the rage into the cruelest stainless-
steel smile she can muster.
CHRIS
(continuing)
Okay.
(dismissively)
See you around, Sue.
And that's it — shut up, shut down, shut out.
Sue turns and starts to walk out of the Cavalier.
In the b.g. behind her, it's all out of focus, an incoherent 
babble of snickering and clucking laughter.
She's crossed the line.

Sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field.
She is preoccupied, still shaken by the afternoon's 
confrontation with Chris. Tommy comes running over to her, 
still in his team uniform, and she gets up.
He gives her a kiss, and puts his arm around her.
They start to walk off together over which we hear, 
intermittently, the following:
SUE

TOMMY

Sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field. She is 
preoccupied, till shaken by the afternoon's con­frontation 
with Chris. The track team is moving past the bleachers (a 
coach in the field clocking them and shouting orders). Tommy, 
in his track uniform, peels away from the group and comes 
running up to Sue.
TOMMY
Hi!,
SUE
I want to talk to you.
TOMMY
Sure, what's up?
To avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in 
front of them, and the other girls sitting in the bleachers 
half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing Tommy and Sue, 
Sue beckons Tommy to follow her away from the group behind 
the bleachers, and as they walk off together we hear the 
following:
SUE
If I asked you to do something for 
me — something special — would you?
TOMMY
(nodding)
Uh-huh.
SUE
No matter how crazy it sounded?
TOMMY
Sure. What?
The sound is muffled, and we don't hear what she says.
But we do hear:
TOMMY
(continuing; ex­ploding )
Are you out of your mind?

A big hangout-cruising night on the boulevard. Neon,

MUSIC.

As a '61 Chevy leaves a sizeable patch of rubber on the 
street as it GRINDS to a hard stop, Just barely halting 
before it almost went through a red light and collided with 
the traffic already in the inter­ section.
INI. THE CHEVY

which belongs to the aforementioned BILLY NOLAN — a character 
whose life and brains stopped around the time he saw "Rebel" 
on television. He’s Chris' boy­ friend, and a huge cross 
swings around his neck. Right now, he's utterly amused by his 
harrowing driving, and turns to Chris who ignores him, still 
brooding over her afternoon losses. Billy takes a huge toke 
from a Joint and hands it to her; she ignores that, too, and 
pro­ceeds to busy herself applying makeup in the visor win­dow. 
So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some banter with 
a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light. The light 
changes, and Billy peels out — an action which throws Chris 
backwards onto the seat.
CHRIS
Goddamnit, Billy!
He just laughs as he weaves through traffic.
CHRIS
(continuing)
Slow down!
(as he pays no heed)
Slow down, you stupid shit!
BILLY
Scared, Chuckle?
CHRIS
No. You'll kill us, you stupid 
shit!
Billy lazily slaps her, speeds up.
BILLY
Don't call me that.
CHRIS
Stupid shit.
He slaps her again.
CHRIS
(continuing: under her 
breath)
53.
Stupid shit.
BILLY

Oh wow!
He slams on the brakes, and pulls into:

As Billy reaches over, very confidently, to draw Chris to 
him.
She lets herself be kissed, then pulls away abruptly.
He grabs at her, and she pulls away.
BILLY
What's wrong?
CHRIS
Can’t you wait a minute?
BILLY
What for?
CHRIS
You're so ignorant.
BILLY
That's what you like.
CHRIS
Bullshit.
BILLY
No? I’ll show you what you like, 
Chuckle.
Grab.
CHRIS
No!
BILLY
Jesus!
54.
Grab.
CHRIS
No!
She pushes him away.
He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle.
Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the but­ tons are 
ripped off.
BILLY
... How you... gonna... explain 
that...
CHRIS
Dumb shit!
He slaps her.
BILLY
What'd I tell you?
Silence. Then, after some time, he leans over and kisses her. 
She lets him. He kisses her again, and she responds. He goes 
at it. And she squirms away.
BILLY
(continuing)
Hell is this?
CHRIS
I want you to do something.
BILLY
What?
(eagerly)
Yeah, what?
CHRIS
I want you to do something for me. 
Something important.
BILLY
(warily)
Something important?
CHRIS
It will be very important to me. It 
will make me feel very good if you 
do it.
55.
She moves closer to him. Her hand dips down out of FRAME. She 
blows in his ear. Billy is beginning to writhe; he moves on 
her, but she holds him off, play­ing him like a puppet.
CHRIS
(continuing)
Billy, I hate Carrie White.

Margaret slowly opens the door to Carrie's room and enters. 
Light filters in from the street. Carrie is lying in bed, 
motionless, asleep.
Margaret crosses the room quietly. She leans over the bed. On 
the table next to it is the glow-in-the-dark statue — not in 
its usual place on the dresser.
Carrie's face, in the soft light, seems very innocent.
MARGARET
(low)
Carrie, did you pray?
No answer.
Margaret bends over Carrie. And with surprising ten­derness, 
she kisses Carrie's forehead.
Then she straightens up quickly, as though she has violated 
herself, and leaves the room.
56.
Carrie opens her eyes. She pulls a book out from under the 
covers^ then she stares at the madonna­ child figurine, and as 
she stares at it, it begins to glow brighter and brighter, 
illuminating the room.
It's bright enough to read by now, and we leave Carrie

She decides on the latter Just as a voice startles her:
TOMMY'S VOICE
Carrie?
CARRIE
Huh?
She stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book 
with her hand, covering the title. He looks as startled as 
she does.
TOMMY
How're you doing?
CARRIE
(after a beat; al­most 
inaudibly)
Okay.
It's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make 
small talk is agonizing. But try it he does:
TOMMY
I thought you had gym this period.
All she can do is shake her head. And a young man not easily 
deterred, he tries again.
TOMMY
(continuing)
What're you reading?
CARRIE
(trying to cover, and not 
very well)
It's about... um... sewing...
Right. Check and stalemate. Which brings him to:
57.
TOMMY
Umm... if you don't have a date for 
the Prom, would you want to go with 
me?
CARRIE
What?
TOMMY
The Prom...
Without saying a word, Carrie walks down the aisle of book 
shelves. He follows her into the main room where students are 
reading, working.
TOMMY
(continuing)
... It's next Friday, and I know 
this is late notice, but they stop 
selling tickets soon, and —
The bell RINGS.
CARRIE
I don’t like to be tricked.
A couple of students stare at Tommy talking to Carrie as they 
start leaving the library.
TOMMY
Carrie...
But it's too late — she’s gone, already out the door.

As Tommy weaves through the crowd after her. Gangly GEORGE 
DAWSON spots him:
GEORGE
Hey, Ross!
But Tommy ignores him in his singular pursuit.
TOMMY
Hey, Carrie! Wait!
A couple of other students watch this — is this their Tommy 
Ross actually trying to speak with Carrie?
58.
But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering — all he 
wants is to catch up with Carrie.
Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird 
moment, this contact. She turns around, her head painfully 
ducked down.
TOMMY
(continuing)
Hey, it's no big deal.
And she looks up and stares at him with that peculiar 
intensity that cuts through all the clamor around them.
Quiet, quietly:
CARRIE
Do you people think you can just go 
on tricking me forever?
A beat. Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much a 
big deal it is. Seeing that she's on the verge of tears, he's 
feeling even worse, and all he can say is:
TOMMY
Sorry.
But it’s too little, and too late. She's crying.
And what's more, she's gone — swallowed up into the clamor of 
students rushing to beat the bell.

sound and to come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the 
dark corners of the room, crying. It's almost as if she 
created her own closet of space.
COLLINS
Carrie?
(on no response)
Carrie, what's the matter?
(on still no re­sponse)
Was it one of the girls? Did one of 
the girls do something to you? Do 
you want a kleenex?

CARRIE
No.
COLLINS
It’s all right. Just tell me, 
there’s nothing to be afraid of.
CARRIE
Miss Collins...
COLLINS
That’s it...
CARRIE
When can I come back to gym?
COLLINS
Not until Monday. Now what is it? 
Are you going to tell me? Come on

CARRIE
I got asked to the prom.
COLLINS
That's great!
CARRIE
Tommy Ross asked me.
COLLINS
Tommy Ross — that's wonderful. He 
is cute.
CARRIE
I know who he goes around with. 
They're trying to trick me again. I 
know.
COLLINS
Maybe he really meant it. I mean, 
maybe he really did mean it. Maybe 
you should think about it. It might 
be fun. You might have a really 
good time!
CARRIE
It would be a nightmare.
COLLINS
60.
C'mon Carrie. You should have a 
better image of yourself. You just

By Tommy Ross.
Morton goes into a coughing fit, accidentally knock­ing over 
his coffee in the process.
Collins watches, slightly amused by his reaction.

Just at this point, NORMA WATSON -- a prissy little pleaser 
with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone 
obsolete — enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets 
for the next week. All conversation ceases.
COLLINS

Yes, Norma? What is it?
NORMA
Just the attendance sheets, Miss 
Collins.
COLLINS
Just leave them on the desk.

You understand, you can’t come 
without a date?
Sue understands perfectly well, but with Norma there, she's 
not about to say a word. And Collins finally picks up on 
this:
COLLINS
(continuing)
Is there something else, Norma?
NORMA
(butter could melt)
No, Miss Collins.
And she exits as slowly as she can — trying to hear the last 
possible word. Then:
COLLINS

Which brings us to you.
TOMMY
Miss Collins, I have to get to

COLLINS
That’s too bad.
TOMMY
Look, this is between Sue and me. 
If you don't mind...

Oh, but I do. Or would you rather 
we continue this discussion in Mr. 
Morton's office.
63.
TOMMY
(bluffed; then off­ 
handedly — like we first 
saw him in Morton's 
class)
What's the big deal?
COLLINS
Because it's a very big deal for 
Carrie White. And you know it.
TOMMY
Anyway, she's already said no.
SUE
You can make her change her mind.
TOMMY
Don't overrate me.
COLLINS
Just don’t try.
TOMMY
Okay.
SUE
It’s not okay.
(to Collins)
You can’t order anyone not to take 
someone to the prom.
COLLINS
I can make sure you don't hurt 
Carrie.
SUE
We’re not trying to hurt her. We’re 
trying to help her.
COLLINS
How?
Silence.
COLLINS

Tommy, when you come to the prom 
with Carrie White, don't you think, 
you’ll look a little ridiculous?
TOMMY
Well...

Aren't you going to ask me in?
She shakes her head; he laughs again, a little ner­ vously. 
Throughout this scene in which he remains on the porch side

No.
TOMMY
Look, I don't do anything I don't 
want to.
CARRIE
I can't.
TOMMY

Carrie glances nervously behind her; then back at Tommy.
CARRIE
You better go.

TOMMY
Don't you think you better answer?

No one, Momma.
TOMMY
You're going with me.
CARRIE
I can't.

You're going.
CARRIE

They'll laugh.
TOMMY
No one'll laugh. We'll see to it.
CARRIE
Please. Please go.
TOMMY
Not 'til you say yes.
Carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; 
helpless, honest, confused. She'd really like to go at this 
point, but that extra sense in her is resist­ing.
CARRIE
Why? Why is it so important to you?
TOMMY
I don't know. Maybe it's because 
you liked my poem.
MARGARET (O.S.)
Carietta!!!
And in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not 
"liked" her poem, had Margaret not called, perhaps she could 
have held back.
CARRIE
Yes.

Okay.
TOMMY
I'll pick you up at eight.
CARRIE
(whispering)
Fine.
(then)
Thank you.
Tommy smiles at her, and turning to leave, touches her hand 
against the screen door. A goodbye, noth­ing more. He goes 
down the walk toward his car.

hair back from her face. A little beautiful? You bet.

Roadhouses. Music. Whiskey. I've 
seen it, all right. Oh, yes.
CARRIE
Momma, you better stop.
MARGARET
You're not going.
CARRIE
I've already said I would, Momma.
MARGARET
Then say no. Say no. Or we'll move.
CARRIE
No.
MARGARET
We'll move away from here, and 
you'll never see that boy again.
A gust of wind causes the window to blow open.
Margaret gets up and starts toward the window.
Carrie is silent, watching herself being shut out.
MARGARET
(continuing)
The rain's coming in.
CARRIE
Momma, sit down.
MARGARET
I'm going to close the windows.
CARRIE
I'll get them. Please sit and talk 
to me.
MARGARET
No.
Margaret continues toward the kitchen window to close it.
Carrie knits her brow, and flex: the window closes.
72.
Margaret whips around, facing Carrie.
CARRIE
I'm going, Momma. And things are 
going to change around here.
Flex.
The SOUND of a window shutting in another room.
MARGARET
Witch!
Flex.
Another window.
MARGARET
(continuing)
It’s Satan's power. First he 
entered your father, carried him 
off...
CARRIE
He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows 
that.
Flex.
A couple of windows.
MARGARET
The devil tempted him.
CARRIE
He ran away with a woman, Momma.
MARGARET
All men are the same. That boy, 
he’s like all the rest, he doesn't 
—
Flex.
The rest of the windows in the house THUNDER shut.
CARRIE
I don't care. He asked me to go. 
And I'm going. I'm going, Momma, 
You can't stop me.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground 
still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a 
group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy 
zoo — a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous 
FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY 
TRENNANT -- trail­ing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound 
sledge hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling 
with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn 
are in the distance.
DE LOIS
Hell of a risk for a joke.
Trennant giggles inanely. Billy stops and glares at De Lois.
BILLY
You want out?
DE LOIS
(hastily)
No, uh-uh.
(then)
It's a good joke, Billy.
A long beat. Billy resumes walking.
DE LOIS
(continuing)
A good joke.
Trennant giggles again.
Garson is stoned silly — zonked, deadpan. He greedily sucks 
the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes.
De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers.
DE LOIS
(continuing)
Hey, piggie...
Trennant just giggles inanely.
Another long beat, then:
DE LOIS
(continuing)
You sure Old Man Henty won't be 
around ?
CHRIS
I told you. He's at a funeral.
74.
Trennant explodes into a fit of high-pitched laughter.
BILLY
Shut up, Henry.
DE LOIS
Whose funeral did he go to?
BILLY
His mother's.
DE LOIS
His mother's? Jesus Christ, she 
musta been older'n God!
Trennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of 
themselves, Billy and Chris start laughing, too.
Even De Lois starts laughing.
The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting:
DE LOIS
(continuing)
That bastard is going to shit where 
he stands when he comes back and 
gets a look.
Garson drops one of the pails on the ground.
BILLY
Asshole.
The sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle:
DISSOLVE TO:
CHRIS' POV - THE HOG PEN
and OVERLAPS INTO the harmonic chanting of De Lois, Trennant 
and Garson;
THE BOYS
Soo-ee, soo-ee, Pig-pig-pig... Soo-

And an old sleeping boar and two sows are GRADUALLY REVEALED.
FULL SHOT - PANNING
the face of the five — COMING TO REST on De Lois.
DE LOIS
75.
Doan worry, piggies, doan worry. 
I'm gonna bash your fuckin' heads 
in, and you woan have to worry 
'bout the bomb no more.
BILLY
Shut up and do it already.
DE LOIS
I will, I will. I'm not gonna even 
give 'em time to burp.
BILLY
The throat.
But it's too late. De Lois has lost all conviction.
DE LOIS
I... can't.
(then)
You.
He hands the sledge hammer to Billy.
Chris, chilled to the bone, rubs herself to keep warm.
CHRIS
Do it, Billy.
Billy touches the ball of his thumb to the edge of the sledge 
hammer.
CHRIS
(continuing)
Do it quick.
And Billy smiles. Yes, he actually smiles. As he raises the 
sledge hammer, we GO TO:

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

The sun shining — perhaps the next day, a day later.
The house is a picture postcard — under it. we hear the 
sweet, muffled sound of "Amazing Grace." It's Just loud 
enough for us to hear it — Joyous, triumphant.

INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix.
The sampler, however, sits in her lap — unfinished, unminded. 
She's virtually catatonic.
"Amazing Grace" — a sweet, contemporary rendition — is on the 
Webcor. A pleasure after Kathryn Kuhlman.
Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the 
pattern for her prom dress. She removes the material from the 
sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet.
MARGARET
Red. I might have known it would be 
red.
The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING.
Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. 
She looks back at Margaret, then turns her attention to the 
machine, her eyes sparkling.
Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine de­ presses 
itself.
The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and 
down... WHIRRING, jerking.
The side wheel spins. And then stops.
CARRIE
(softly)
Only clearing the thread, Momma.
She smiles. Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her 
room.
Margaret looks after her. Hate. And fear.
MARGARET
(abruptly)
It's Satan.
Carrie pauses.
CARRIE
(wearily; pitying)
Oh, Momma.
MARGARET
He has given you a power.
77.
CARRIE
Momma, it doesn't have anything to 
do with Satan. It's me. If I 
concentrate hard enough, I can make 
things move.
MARGARET
Satan is clever.
CARRIE
Momma, there are other people... 
people with the power... It's a 
part of me...
MARGARET
Satan...
CARRIE
If it were, I'd know it.
MARGARET
You poor child. He doesn't let you 
know he's working through you.
CARRIE
Momma, I'd know,
MARGARET
You are to renounce that power. You 
must give it up. You must never use 
it.
CARRIE
I'm going to do my homework, Momma.
Another step up the stairs, stopping as Margaret hurls after 
her:
MARGARET
There's going to be a judgement!
There's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, 
and we:

Silence, then a SCRAPING sound of a:

being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face — 
just whose isn’t clear yet. The slip-lock comes free, the 
sill is pushed up, and Billy’s head appears. Chris is right 
behind him.
LONG SHOT - THE GYM
as a flashlight is shined upwards — at criss-crossing girders 
sheathed in crepe paper; at banks of lights which will later 
be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular -
- the huge wall mural, and the chalked-in spot where the King 
and Queen of the Prom will be crowned.
TWO SHOT - BILLY AND CHRIS
DOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage 
area -- past the numerous tables set up for the prom-goers, 
past the twin bandstands. Billy is carry­ing the ice chest, 
Chris the flashlight.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down 
and takes out a pair of Playtex rubber gloves, snaps them on. 
Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine.
CHRIS' POV - BILLY
looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a 
ladder which takes him up to a narrow platform over­ looking 
the stage area.
CLOSEUP - CHRIS
shining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with 
excitement.
BILLY
as he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures 
the girders over the stage.
CHRIS
unable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone.
CHRIS
What's it like up there?
(no response)
Billee?
(no answer; genuinely 
scared)
Billy!
79.
And just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into 
the FRAME and lands in Chris' hair. She jumps, utterly 
unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from 
the platform, grinning.
BILLY
Boo.
CHRIS
You stupid shit.
BILLY
(still in good humor)
Nice talk.
CHRIS
Hurry up. Do you hear me, just 
hurry up!
BILLY
(blackface)
Yes'um, yes'um. Weeze doing the 
best we can.
CHRIS
I want to go home.
BILLY
Just keep your tits on and I'll let 
you pull it when the time comes.
CHRIS
I plan to.

A SERIES OF SCENES - LEADING TO THE PROM
CUTTING between the final arrangements for the Prom itself 
and Carrie’s preparations as the night approaches.
The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, al­ though 
this montage — scored throughout with happier and happier 
MUSIC — will also feature some of our lesser characters.
Among other things, we will see:
A) THE GYM -- as last-minute arrangements are made -- more 
crepe-paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.;
B) CARRIE — in a town store as she shops for makeup;
80.
C) NORMA WATSON -- under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile 
a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly 
exhausted;
D) TOMMY — picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist;
E) CARRIE — at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which 
we still don’t see), a happy look on her face;
F) THE GYM — as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the 
mural on the stage wall;
G) SUE — having dinner with her parents;
H) THE TWINS -- in front of their dressing tables; both of 
them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously;
I) ERNEST — the class president -- making sure the microphone 
on the stage works;
J) THE BAND -- among them, the Beak, setting up;
K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton 
act;
L) A DOOR -- which opens to reveal The Twins in their high 
heels, both of them several inches taller than their 
depressed-looking dates;
M) GEORGE AND FRIEDA — he in his tuxedo, she in her prom 
dress; a flash as Frieda’s parents take a Polaroid of this 
night to remember;
N) THE GYM -- with the adult chaperones -- teachers, 
administrators — standing around looking for something to do.
It is now the night of the Prom -- just minutes before it 
officially begins, and we end this montage and

INT. CARRIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
56
56
Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but thistime, 
there's a different attitude.
And a different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, 
very different, from before. She's dressed in her lush red 
crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a 
way that we don’t see it.
In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She 
looks... well, there has been a trans­formation.
81.
In the b.g., the door is opened by Margaret.
CARRIE
Come in, Momma.
Margaret advances into the room.
Carries opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of 
tiny tea roses.
CARRIE
Do you want to pin it on, Momma?
MARGARET
I can see your dirtypillows. 
Everyone will.
CARRIE
Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every 
woman has them.
Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will 
spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this scene — and all 
that follow for a considerable period of time — has an edge 
of unreality to it. It's all been diffused a bit — a fairy 
tale through Carrie's eyes.
What would look bad or tacky looks acceptable; what looked 
good before how looks spectacular.
MARGARET
Take off that dress.
CARRIE
No.
MARGARET
We’ll burn it together, we’ll pray 
for forgiveness.
CARRIE
No, Momma.
The Black Forest CUCKOO CLOCK sings out downstairs.
It's eight o'clock.
MARGARET
He’s not coming.
CARRIE
Stop it, Momma. I’m nervous enough.­
82.
Margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leav­ing a red 
mark. She looks toward Carrie.
Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself.
Margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, 
leaving a thin line of blood.
CARRIE
Stop hurting yourself, Momma. 
That's not going to stop me either.
Margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.
CARRIE
Go away, Momma.
MARGARET
You know I’m right. He’ll laugh at 
you. They’ll all laugh at you.
CARRIE
No. It'll be okay.
But she’s rattled, and nervously starts moving around a 
series of objects in the room. Cosmetics on the bureau, the 
florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue.
But it’s sheer will at this point. It’s after eight, and 
there’s no sign of Tommy.
MARGARET
It’s not too late. You can stay 
here with me.
CARRIE
No.
MARGARET
I’ll answer the door and say you’re 
sick, I’ll say —
CARRIE
Momma, sit on the bed.
Flex.
Margaret is pushed back on the bed. Horrified, she rises 
again.
MARGARET
I'll say you changed your mind, 
I’ll say --
83.
Flex.
Margaret is thrust back on the bed.
MARGARET
'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to 
live.'
The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as 
Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's voice is soft and 
compassionate.
CARRIE
You'll say nothing, Momma. You are 
going to have to learn that I’m not 
like you, not anymore.
The BUZZER downstairs sounds. Carrie goes to her window and 
sees-
CARRIE'S POV - TOMMY
at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, 
making it glisten. He looks very handsome.
CARRIE
She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to 
Margaret:
CARRIE
I’ll be home early, Momma.
The BUZZER downstairs sounds again.
MARGARET
There’s going to be a judgment!
CARRIE
Momma, you will be quiet until I'm 
gone.
(beat; then, at the door)
I love you, Momma.
And she's gone, down the
STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, TO THE FRONT DOOR - TRACKING
Carrie who opens the door.
ANGLE ON TOMMY
Well, we know he’s beautiful. And he’s looking at Carrie. He 
didn't know:

He didn’t know she could be beautiful. And she is.
TOMMY AND CARRIE
He reaches out his hand.
TOMMY
Hi.
Carrie takes his hand.

Margaret leaves the window as we HEAR Tommy's car drive off.
She goes out of the room.
TRACKING MARGARET
Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. 
Almost the same path that Carrie trod, but trod so 
differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously 
expectant, Margaret's is slow and heavy.
INT. WHITE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Margaret crosses to one of the drawers.
She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams

The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars

INT. TOMMY'S CAR

as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the 
other couples getting out of their cars. Tommy •watches her 
taking it all in.
CARRIE
It's like a dream.
TOMMY
You can still change your mind, you 
know.
She turns to him and realizes he’s teasing her.
CARRIE
Easier said than done.
TOMMY
(grinning)
C'mon.
CARRIE
No. Please — not yet.
TOMMY
Scared?
CARRIE
Yes.
(beat)
Can we sit here another minute?
Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is 
miserable — she's happy to be with Tommy, she's trying to 
have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to 
dance the first time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this 
one out.
CARRIE
Tommy...
(and then out it comes)
Maybe... maybe this was a mistake.
TOMMY
Hey, it won't be so bad.
She tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive.
TOMMY
Really, I mean it. They're okay, 
you'll see.
(beat; she's try­ing to 
believe him)
86.
Don't be nervous. Besides...
(a little self-mocking)
I'd look awfully silly dancing by 
myself.
And that's enough -- he's taken her mind off her own fear 
just enough to make her laugh.
CUT TO:
INT. GYM
62

where the Prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an 
energetic version of "Harlem Nocturne." From CARRIE'S POV 
it's all magic — explosions of pastel color, everyone looking 
like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.
Carrie just stands at the double doors which are the main 
entrances to the gym, taking it all in as Tommy hands their 
tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant 
mural on the stage wall -- full of celestial moon, stars and 
rockets -- a VOICE bellows out behind her.
VOICE
Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.
GEORGE DAWSON
the source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend.
He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a T-shirt with a painted black 
tie under his dinner jacket. His girl­ friend, Frieda Jason, 
tags behind.
TOMMY
When did you cone out of the 
treetops, Bomba?
GEORGE
Ross, if I'd known you were going 
to look this good, I'd have asked 
you instead of Frieda.
The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes 
up to Carrie.
FRIEDA
Don't let it bother you. If they 
destroy each other, I'll dance with 
you.
Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward 
silence.
87.
FRIEDA
Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I 
love it.
CARRIE
(shyly)
I made it.
FRIEDA
(unaffected surprise)
Made it? No shit.
Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.
CARRIE
No shit.
Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. 
Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye on Carrie. He shrugs -- it's 
working, goddammit — and he stuffs his hands in his dinner 
jacket.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GYM
Carrie and Frieda, Tommy and George right behind them, head 
for their tables.
FRIEDA
The mural's nice.
CARRIE
Yes.
(confiding)
I'm really nervous.
FRIEDA
S'okay. We're sitting together.
And she takes Carrie’s arm.
Norma Watson rushes over to them — all breathy taffeta and 
green chiffon.
NORMA
Carrie!
(looking her up and down)
That's a lovely dress, Carrie. 
Wherever did you get it?
CARRIE
I made it.
NORMA
88.
Well, of course you did. I can't 
get over it, you look so different. 
You're positively glowing. What's 
your secret?
CARRIE
I'm Don MacLean's secret lover.
NORMA
(a half-beat late, 
getting it, tittering)
Don MacLean's secret... How funny 
you are.
(cutting her)
Why, hello Tommy. Aren't you 
excited?
TOMMY
Cold sweat is running down my 
thighs in rivers.
NORMA
(smile slipping a full 
notch now)
Well, I have to hurry back. Stan'll 
think I got lost.
GEORGE
(King Kong; right on top 
of her)
Bom-ba!
NORMA
(tittering, moving away 
smack, into Frieda)
And, Frieda, don’t you look nice.
FRIEDA
(toothpaste smile)
Get douched, Norma.
And the four of them march off like musketeers. Norma is left 
standing there in her chiffon — looking... well, douched.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE
as the Prom gets underway:
A) JOSIE AND THE MOONGLOWS — THE BAND -- make like Lawrence 
Welk and launch into an oldie-but-goodie. On drums — The Beak 
himself.

B) THE TWINS — CORA AND RHONDA — dressed identically, dancing 
with
C) ERNEST PETERSON, the black class president, is wonderfully 
officious as he gets the evening’s first entertainment 
organized. It (or she) is —
D) SANDRA STENCHFELD and her fabulous twirling baton
act, a phenomenon to the lilting STRAINS of "Raindrops Are 
Falling on My Head."
E) NORMA is off in a corner, bending another girl's ear; STAN 
is standing by idly, pretending to be invisible.
F) MORTON, FROMM, and the other chaperones including Miss 
Fish look for something to do, for someone who's stepping out 
of line. And find it. In the person of BILLY DE LOIS who’s 
guzzling the punch.
G) TOMMY and CARRIE sit at their table next to George and 
Frieda. Tommy lights a chandle.

as Josie and the Moonglows launch into a new NUMBER. George 
suddenly comes to life.
GEORGE
Viiibes!
He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance 
floor, Frieda shrugging helplessly at Carrie.
CARRIE
They’re nice. George is funny.
TOMMY
He’s a good guy.
(beat)
See, didn’t I tell you?
(beat)
Sure you don’t want to dance?
CARRIE
Could we just sit here for a 
minute?
Tommy nods — it’s okay with him.
VOICE
Carrie?
90.
Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins -- 
dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a 
teacher.
CARRIE
You look very pretty, Miss Collins.
COLLINS
Thank you.
(beat)
You, too. Beautiful.
CARRIE
It’s awfully nice of you to say so. 
I know I'm not... not really ... 
but thank you anyway.
Tommy — feeling like a fifth wheel -- clears his throat and 
stands up.
TOMMY
’Scuse me.
(to Carrie)
Be right back, okay?
He goes off into the crowd.
COLLINS
(gesturing to his seat)
May I?
Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to 
her. They're virtually alone at this moment; every­ one else 
is dancing or occupied.
COLLINS
Carrie, anything that happened 
before... well, it's all forgotten. 
I wanted you to know that.
CARRIE
I can't forget it.
(beat)
But it's over with. It's over.
Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's 
eyes follow hers. At this particular moment, the band is 
PLAYING a quiet number -- slow, romantic.
COLLINS
91.
I remember my own prom. I was two 
inches taller than the boy I went 
with when I was in my heels. He 
gave me a corsage that clashed with 
my gown. But it was magic. I don't 
know why. But I’ve never had a date 
like it, ever since. Is it like 
that - for you?
CARRIE
It' s very... nice.
COLLINS
(smiling)
Just nice?
CARRIE
No. There's more. I don't know...
(hesitating; then)
... it's like being on Mars.
COLLINS
You'll never forget it.
CARRIE
I think you’re right.
And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, 
hugs her tightly.
CARRIE
Thank you.
COLLINS
Have a lovely time, Carrie.
TOMMY (O.S.)
Hey, what’s going on here?
There is Tommy, looking "stern."
'TOMMY
(to Collins)
What are you doing with my date?
COLLINS
Girl secrets.
A smile at Carrie, and she goes off.
TOMMY
Don’t let me catch you hugging any 
guys.
92.
CARRIE
You won't.
TOMMY
Better not. Hey, listen, do you 
really have to be back so early?
CARRIE
I promised.
TOMMY
Okay. I understand.
CARRIE
I’m sorry.
TOMMY
No, it's okay. Listen, the other 
kids are going over to Lewiston 
after the Prom —
CARRIE
(breaking in)
That's okay.
TOMMY
What is?
CARRIE
You want to go with your friends. I 
don't want to spoil anything...
TOMMY
Hey, let me finish. What I was 
going to say, I mean if it'd be all 
right with you, what do you say we 
go to the Cavalier?
CARRIE
(surprised; she'd love 
to)
I've never been there.
TOMMY
Hey, great. We'll have the place 
all to ourselves. Great!
(he means it)
Then it's settled.
He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor.
CARRIE
(holding back)
Tommy...
93.
TOMMY
C'mon...
CARRIE
I don't... I can't... I...
TOMMY
You can.
He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out 
onto the floor. He is a young man of considerable confidence 
— the best part of his popularity — and it's a contagious 
trait. Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the (slow) 
dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins 
to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to 
glide into her freedom.
A CORNER OF THE GYM
Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit 
breathless and very happy. For some moments, Tommy keeps his 
arms around Carrie, looking at her.
And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, im­pulsively. 
And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is 
immediately embarrassed.
TOMMY
Hey...
CARRIE
I’m sorry.
TOMMY
I. ..
CARRIE
It's just...
TOMMY
No harm, no foul.
They stand there for a couple of seconds.
And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It’s a quick, 
awkward, frightened kiss. A bird peck.
And again they stand there, until:
CARRIE
I don’t know... anything. I can’t 
dance...
TOMMY
94.
You danced.
CARRIE
I don’t even know how to...
TOMMY
It’s easy.
And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him.
CARRIE
Tommy... why?
TOMMY
Why what?
CARRIE
Why am I here?
TOMMY
It’s the Prom.
CARRIE
With you.
TOMMY
Because I asked you. And...
CARRIE
Why? Why did you?
TOMMY
Because I wanted to.
CARRIE
Why?
TOMMY
Because...
He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.
TOMMY
... You liked my poem. Only I 
didn't write it. Someone else did.
CARRIE
Oh.
She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.
TOMMY
(quickly)
95.
Look, Carrie, we're here, we're 
together... and I like it, you know 
... I mean, I...
CARRIE
But...
A commotion from the floor.
Tommy turns.
TOMMY
Hey, look!
Carrie looks off, following his glance, at:
STAGE AREA - POV
as the head Custodian supervises the sliding of two thrones 
from the wings onto pre--set marks on the stage apron. 
They're sheathed in white — strewn with crepe papers and 
flowers to match the prom's celestial theme.
CARRIE AND TOMMY
CARRIE
(uneasily)
It's a fairy tale.
TOMMY
(Learning; taking her 
arm)
C'mon.
He starts to lead her towards their table while:

Sue Snell -- unable to contain hex* curiosity about how all

Class President Ernest Peterson makes his way to the 
microphone. He takes all this quite seriously.
ERNEST

All right, ladies and gentlemen. 
Take your seats, please — it’s time 
for the voting.
NORMA
This contest is an insult to women!
A couple of CHEERS, scattered APPLAUSE.
GEORGE
It insults men, too!
Louder CLAPPING, foot STOMPING, WHISTLES.
ERNEST
(over the noise)
Please take your seats. It's time 
to vote for the King and Queen.
Several ushers go up and down the aisles, passing out 
ballots.
ANGLE - TOMMY AND CARRIE’S TABLE
as Norma Watson haughtily drops a ballot on their table in 
front of Tommy, another in front of George.
Carrie examines the paper.
CARRIE
Tommy...
(looking up to see him 
smiling at her)
... we're on here!
TOMMY
I know.
(seeing her concern)
Want to decline?
CARRIE
Do you want to?
TOMMY
Hell, no. If you win, all you do is 
sit up there for the school song 
and one dance. And they put our 
picture in the yearbook so everyone 
can see we looked like idiots. 
Besides, it's the last year.
Carrie looks up at the stage --at the massive thrones all in 
white.
97.
CARRIE
They're beautiful.
TOMMY
You're beautiful.
Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelm­ing her, 
and she has to look away — at the tiny party favor boat on 
the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it.
CARRIE
Who do we vote for? They're more 
your crowd than mine.
TOMMY
Whatever you like.
CARRIE
(small laugh)
In fact, I don't really have a 
crowd.
TOMMY
Let's vote for ourselves. To the 
devil with false modesty.
She laughs aloud -- the sound of her own laughter is so 
foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth, at her 
own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their 
names -- so quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small 
drop of blood to her finger.
She gasps.
TOMMY
Hurt yourself?
CARRIE
No.
(trying to smile)
But I broke it and it was a 
souvenir.
TOMMY
There's still your boat.

toward her)
Toot, toot.

The ballots are being counted, Morton and Fish helping Ernest 
separate them into piles. We ought to notice either De Lois

Watson as well.
ANGLE - TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLE
Carrie is holding Tommy's hand tightly -- too tightly.
TOMMY
Hey, hey.
CARRIE
Sorry.
TOMMY
Don't know your own strength. Whew.
He sees she's taking him seriously. Sensitive to her 
reaction, he smiles at her.
TOMMY
Hey, it's okay.
In the b.g. Josie and the Moonglows provide a flourish of 
DRUMS.
THE STAGE
as Ernest walks up to the microphone and almost drops the 
ballots in the process.
ERNEST
We've sort of hit a snag. Mr. 
Morton says this is the first time 
in the history of the Spring Prom 
that -­

How far does he go back? 1800?
LAUGHTER, CATCALLS.
ERNEST
We've got a tie.
GEORGE

Polka dot or striped?
ERNEST
Sixty-three votes for Frank Grier 
and Cora Wilson, and sixty-three 
votes for Tommy Ross and Carrie 
White.
Silence, then the APPLAUSE begins and starts to swell as 
we...

an island in the APPLAUSE around her, her head lowered...
TOMMY
watching her intently, his mouth slightly open...

vainly trying to speak over the APPLAUSE.
ERNEST
Attention! If I could have your 
attention, please...
TOMMY AND CARRIE
Tommy staring at her
ERNEST (O.S.)
We’re going to have a run-off 
ballot. When you get yours, please 
write the couple you favor on it.

CARRIE
They're not applauding for us. It 
can't be for us.
TOMMY
Maybe it's for you.

Just exactly where they are isn't clear yet, nor should it

BILLY

What?
CARRIE
Don't vote for us.

TOMMY
In for a penny, in for a pound. 
That's what my grandmother used to 
say.
CARRIE
(swallowing)
Don't. Please.
Tommy hesitates for a second, seeing her face so full of 
premonition. Then he overcomes it, and scrawls their names on 
the slip of paper, folding it.
TOMMY
For you.
He hands it to Norma Watson, and it's off — spirited away, 
gone.
TOMMY
Tonight you go first-class.
Carrie stares at the receding figure of Norma as if she were 
the messenger of doom.

GYM DOOR - POV
as Sue manages to slip by Fromm who's still lazily monitoring 
the door. She starts heading for the back-stage area, trying 
to be as unobtrusive as possible.
NORMA
At the voting table; she spies Sue coming in and finding it 
irresistible, blurts out the news whispering to:

as Ernest returns to the microphone.
The BAND plays another FANFARE OF DRUMS. Ernest sees this as 
his big moment; he almost drops the ballots.
He pauses for a moment, surveying the gym floor and the 
anxious prom-goers. An actor savoring the tension.
Then he smiles, white teeth grinning:
ERNEST
Tomray and Carrie win. By one vote.
Begin SLOW MOTION.
Silence -- everything a half-beat exaggerated, slowed.
Carrie gasps inwardly; the candle in front of her blows out.
Tommy grins, amused. He shrugs his shoulders at Carrie.
And the APPLAUSE begins -- some of it, most of it, genuine, 
but some of it mocking, too.
The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and 
Circumstance."
Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table. George is pounding 
Tommy's back. An aluminum-foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's 
hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over Carrie's 
shoulders.
SUE - STAGE WINGS
peering out farther to get a good look. Unseen at first by 
her, there's a cord on the edge of the FRAME.
MORTON
Blocked by the clamor of students, he's unable to make a 
straight bee-line for Sue in the wings. So he takes the long 
way around -- back behind the stage...
TOMMY AND CARRIE
DOLLYING as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of 
smiling faces, the APPLAUSE SWELLING. They're being led 
toward the stage area the thrones waiting for them. The

THE STAGE
as Tommy gives Carrie his hand, helping her up the steps, 
over tangles of black power cables.
BENEATH THE STAGE
where we finally reveal just where Chris and Billy have been 
hiding all this time. Chris listens to the foot­ steps (of 
Carrie and Tommy) coming overhead; grasping the cord that 
Billy has hooked up, holding it very tightly...
CARRIE AND TOMMY
as they're helped into the massive thrones; behind them is 
the huge mural of stars and ships...
ERNEST
the showman now, P. T. Barnum in all of his expansive­ ness.
SUE
In the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the 
FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier -- the same one which 
Chris clutched beneath the stage -- jiggles, and Sue notices 
it move. She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it 
goes up to:
A BANK OF LIGHTS
concealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile:
CARRIE
staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing -- so 
hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new 
set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it 
harder.

The implications of the cord and tucket positioned over the 
thrones just starting to dawn on her as every­ one begins 
singing the school song:

Hiyyyyh...
And a hand comes into FRAME, clutching Sue's wrist.
It belongs to:
MORTON
What're you doing here, young lady?
SUE
(trying to head for cord 
under stage)
Something's wrong!
ALL (O.S.)
We'll raise your banner to the 
skyyyh...
But Morton has no interest in what Sue is trying to tell him:
MORTON
I'll say there is.

From the throne, she sees Sue -- and Morton as he pulls her 
toward the back exit.

Chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song 
continues.

Chris is frozen -- immobilized, terrified.

and noise...

whyyyte...
BILLY

It can stay there until hell 
freezes over, Chuckle.
Chris shudders involuntarily at the mention of this nickname. 
She violently jerks the cord with both hands, yanking it. A 
sound half-scream, half-moan — comes from her mouth, 
overlapping into:
CARRIE
sitting on the throne next to Tommy; above her, some­ thing 
flashes -- a glint of metal reflected by the lights...
THE STEEL BUCKET
high above the stage, slowly tipping over, the blood pouring 
from it.
LONG SHOT - THE STAGE
almost proscenium-like in this FRAMING, from all the way in

Carrie and Tommy sit on their huge thrones as the buckets

dangling on the pulleys over the throne, clanging back and 
forth. A high-pitched GIRL'S VOICE SCREAMS.
TOMMY
splattered with blood. Below them, the sounds of hysteria 
begin ("My God, that's blood!"). Tommy starts toward Carrie 
just as:

unconscious, and he slumps to the floor.

uncontrollably, the kind of hysterical laugh that comes out 
of pure terror. It overlaps onto:

as Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the 
black power cords. A horrified Collins is on her way up the 
stairs.
COLLINS
Oh, Carrie -- let me help you.
Carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher. But it's too 
late for help, and in the fastest flex we've seen to date, 
she jerks her head and Collins bounces back­ ward -- down the 
stairs, slamming into a wall.
THE STUDENTS
laughing even harder now, unable to stop.
THE GYM - ANOTHER ANGLE
where all is pandemonium.
Morton makes his way to Collins, giving her his hand­ 
kerchief; she has a bloody nose.
COLLINS

Call the police!
CARRIE
tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she 
takes in the sight of her tormentors.
THE GYM - YET ANOTHER ANGLE
Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to 
throw up or go into shock.
George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over 
the slumped figure of Tommy Ross, examining him.
GEORGE

quick!
He tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne 
topples over on the stage.

eyes and sees:

all of them open, a few students milling around them as...
CARRIE
closes her eyes even tighter, and flexes. And -- in SWISH 
PANS:
THE DOORS
slam shut. In the process, several things are accom­plished at 
once. The prom-goers are trapped inside, and one or two of 
them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they 
close, screaming with surprise and pain. •

Utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors.
THE BEAK
near the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and 
realizing that it's Carrie who’s responsible for closing the 
doors.
THE BEAK
It's Carrie! It1s Carrie!
Fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the 
microphone, to stop the panic.
The kids continue rushing toward the closed doors.
CARRIE

A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one 
responsible the one with the power now. It's not what she 
wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her 
now and never forget her.

spray a burst of water.

THE STUDENTS
Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, 
ruining their clothes.

CARRIE
eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and 
surveys --
THE STUDENTS
like rats in a maze -- a slapstick chaos as they try to get 
away from the animated hose. The water forces the students 
back from the doors, backwards toward the stage.
CHRIS AND BILLY - UNDER THE STAGE
as they see students propelled toward them by the hose.
CARRIE

A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing 
them -- they’re the ones being made to look foolish. He's 
standing on one side of the stage.
THE STAGE AREA
as the hose now starts to rain water on the thrones, on the 
place where the blood fell, washing it away.
ERNEST
level-headed to the end, making his way through the 
pandemonium toward the stage area and the bandstand as fast 
as he can...
CARRIE
Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move 
toward the stage area.
TRACKING - ERNEST
knowing somehow — with some sixth sense -- that Carrie's 
watching him. He feverishly hurries toward the area where the 
band equipment is plugged in... where the high voltage cables 
are hooked up to the electrical current.
Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to 
be heard, telling everyone to remain calm.
CARRIE
realizing just what Ernest plans to do:
CARRIE
(gently; determined)
No.
And she mentally fixes on him, jerking her head just so... so 
--
ERNEST
is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by 
Carrie’s will.
FROMM
Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike. He puts his 
hand on it. The water, however, has reached him, and just as 
he touches the mike, he's electrocuted --

his arm bursting into flame, unable to let go as his body 
goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a 
fish on land.
CARRIE
watching this; another flex, and:
FROMM
is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward 
into the eye, his flaming arm igniting it.
A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames.
It prevents any of the students from using the back exit.
THE STUDENTS
watching, rivetted with horror, some of them screaming, 
others frozen to the spot as the eye CRACKLES. Utter 
pandemonium.
CARRIE
her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart 
pounding. She spots:
THE LIGHTING T-BAR
hanging over the bandstand.
THE DOORS
as the prom-goers press against the opaque glass, straining 
to get out. Fish in an aquarium.
COLLINS

bout with Carrie.
CARRIE
her heart pounding like an anvil. She's staring at:
THE LIGHTING BAR
CARRIE
She flexes.
CEILING POV

Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting 
bar. We see the flaming eye on the stage collapse forward. 
The-light bar begins to shake.
Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS -- just short of 
Collins' head — as far as its wires carry it.
CARRIE
watching all this — a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerg­ing from 
deep within her.
Another flex:
THE LIGHT BAR
starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, 
back and forth -- it hits the ceiling, igniting it and the 
decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from 
the ceiling.
BENEATH THE STAGE - BILLY AND CHRIS
seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the 
light bar.
The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the out­ side, 
and which the eye flames prevented any of the students on the 
gym floor from getting to) is now free, and Billy and Chris 
see their chance to escape. They burst out from under the 
stage as:
CARRIE
spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what 
they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and 
there's absolutely nothing she can do.
THE GYM - FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR
as it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually 
whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back 
into a wall.
Helen Shyres is backed into a comer, giggling with horror, in 
shock, utterly hysterical.
Students have climbed onto the back bleachers, trying in vain 
to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape.
Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through 
another of the windows. All this to no avail.
End SPLIT SCREEN.

CARRIE
as she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the 
floor. She spots the cord going under the stage first, and 
realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and 
Chris did it.

the windows, we see a wall of fire collapse behind her.
She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically.

find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS ... and BLOWS. It

Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like 
a girl than the survivor of a grisly car accident; wet, caked

down a hill, and then, from:
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE HILL - NIGHT
as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie.
And then shortly afterwards, out of nowhere, Billy's Chevy -- 
its headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right

It just misses her.

Billy is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back

BILLY

BILLY
Shut up! Just shut up!
But the car is headed for an embankment. Billy realizes this 
and starts pumping the brakes. But the car's accelerating, 
not responding to Billy's efforts to slow it down.
CARRIE
her head pounding, flexing...
INT. CHEVY

as Billy attempts to turn the wheel; it, too, has turned 
traitor --- it won't turn.
They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are

THE CHEVY
plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. 
It then bursts into a sheet of flames.
116.
CARRIE
watching this explosion turn into a conflagration.
We see the fire reflected in her puffy, exhausted face -- 
brighter and brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of 
the WHISTLE merging with the SOUND OF SIRENS, and:

The house is totally dark. Not even a porch light.
In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the burning

A figure is moving toward the house.
It is Carrie.
AT DOOR
Carrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it 
partially.
CARRIE

Momma? Momma?
She opens the door wider.

With the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light.
She looks around. The house is ominously empty, ominously

Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as 
she goes. She mounts the stairs, goes along the narrow 
hallway to her room.

Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door.

it lie in a heap.
Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.

Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot.
It is almost steaming as she steps in.
Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.
Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself briefly, puts 
on her robe, and turns off the bathroom light.
What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to 
focus on Carrie.

Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair 
hangs. A feeling of despair about her; or perhaps she is 
emptied out.
Carrie almost mouths:
CARRIE
Momma...
It is a little child's voice, and there is no answer.
She goes out into the hallway.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

118.
Carrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths 
the words:
CARRIE
Momma...
Something -- a movement? an instinct? -- makes her turn. She 
sees:
MARGARET
coming toward her.
CARRIE
She flings out her arms and cries out:
CARRIE
Oh, Momma!
And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement 
from Margaret, a quick movement hard to define. And Carrie 
recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.
Briefly we see the knife in Margaret’s hand.
Then Carrie tumbles down, the stairs.
ANGLE DOWN STAIRS
on Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of 
the stairs.
MARGARET
Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.
MARGARET
It says in the Lord's Book: 'Thou 
shalt not suffer a witch to live.'
CARRIE
Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything 
distorted. She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on 
her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the 
stairs.
MARGARET
And now the devil has come here.
CARRIE
(whimpering)
Momma, it’s not right.
119.
Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
89
89
Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she 
reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the 
knife gleaming in her hand, point toward Carrie, reaches the 
bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling 
all the while.
Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.
Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.
Carrie flexes again -- to hold the door shut.
But it's no use -- Margaret is relentless now, and the door 
opens. She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the 
door swinging behind her.
MARGARET
I should have killed you when you 
were born.
CARRIE
Momma, I love you. Please help me!
MARGARET
Sin never dies.
There’s nothing else to be done; Carrie flexes, and a serving 
fork -- dangling from a hook on wall -­ suddenly hurtles 
through the air, piercing Margaret.
It is followed by another and another as a rain of 
instruments strikes Margaret.
Margaret collapses.
Carrie, horrified by what she’s done, starts toward her 
mother.
And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping 
her hands to her mouth, stifling her screams.
CARRIE
You. You tricked me.
SUE
No.
CARRIE
Get out.
120.
SUE
We were just trying...
CARRIE
Get out.
And then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A 
stone.
Then another.
Then a third.
CARRIE
Get out! Get out!
The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.
Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.
CARRIE
Get out, get out, get out!
The stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of 
them break through the roof, rattle on the floor above.
CARRIE
GET OUT!
A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the 
kitchen.
Carrie flexes.
And Sue stumbles backwards, toward the door.
Flex.
Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.

Stones are crashing on the house.
Sue is hurtled out of the house.
INT. KITCHEN

as a couple of larger stones crash into the room, Carrie 
heads for the closet.
121.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
92

Sue, rising from the ground, sees stones crashing into the 
house.
She begins to run away.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
93
93
Carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of Jesus is 
illuminated welcoming her9 She goes into the closet.
She closes the door.
Stones crash down, obliterating the scene.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
94
94
Sue stops running. She turns to look at the White house.
WHITE HOUSE - SUE'S POV
The stones are flattening the house. The house is being 
pounded into the ground.
SUE
Terror and disbelief. Nightmare.
THE WHITE HOUSE
The rain of stones stops.
Silence.
Then the house begins to sink -- slowly, slowly, slowly -- 
into the ground.
And the ground is swallowing up the house.
And covering it over until -- nothing remains.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
95
95
where the Horan house used to stand, where now only a FOR 
SALE sign remains.
122.
We PAN OVER next door, to where the White house used to be. 
This lot, too, is vacant — overgrown with grass and weeds and 
maybe wildflowers. It is also strewn with beer cans.
And there is another FOR SALE sign. We come in closer and 
realize that there's some writing on the sign, some hastily 
written graffiti. Which reads:
CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING FOR HER SINS
And underneath:
JESUS NEVER FAILS
HOLD for a long beat, then:
FADE OUT.
THE END
THE WHITE HOUSE
The rain of stones stops.
Silence.
Then the house begins to sink -- slowly, slowly — into the 
ground.
And the ground swallows up the house.
And covers it over until nothing remains. Not a trace.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SNELL HOUSE - DAY
96
96
Some time later — a week, perhaps two weeks after the night­ 
mares of Prom Night.
INT. SNELL HOUSE
97
97
A home in the course of losing its family. White sheets over 
furniture. Boxes in the midst of being packed.
Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the 
last minute details of moving. She sorts through magazines 
and books, discarding some, putting others in cartons. And 
she comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret 
White, forgotten until now. They have a momentary hypnotic­ 
effect on her.
123.
The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in 
the kitchen, catching it on the first or second ring.
ELEANOR
(hushed voice)
Hello? Oh, thank God it's you, 
Betty. I don't think I could have 
handled one more reporter.
(she appears to hear a 
noise upstairs)
Just a sec, dear.
(she comes into the 
living room and looks 
toward the upstairs)
Sue?
(a little louder)
Sue?
(no answer^ she returns 
to the phone)
Sorry, Betty, I just wanted to make 
sure the phone didn't wake her. 
We're all a bit edgy.
(beat)
Better. Sleeping too much, I guess, 
but Schnei­der says that’s to be 
expected after what she's gone 
through. He says she's young enough 
to forget it in time.
As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera 
conveys her tension. Half of her is listening and talking to 
Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good 
cause. Because:
EXT. EMPTY LOT - DAY
98
98
Where the Horan house used to stand, now vacant. Strewn with 
beer cans, overgrown with grass and weeds and wild­ flowers. 
And a FOR SALE sign.
We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand.
It, too, is vacant but utterly bald — there's been no time 
for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put 
up by Born Realty.
SUE SNELL -
Looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the looney side 
from a lack of sleep stands staring at the lot.
She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.
124.
THE WHITE LOT - SUE'S POV
As she slowly walks toward it. Underwater, almost floating. 
We come in closer on the sign which now starts ap­pearing a 
bit odder — less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a 
grave marker.
And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has 
been hastily scrawled in chalk on the sign:
CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING FOR HER SINS
And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's 
notion of one final joke:
JESUS NEVER FAILS
SUE -
As she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carring next to 
the marker. She proceeds to try to wipe off the red chalk 
with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.
She stares at he hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in 
the shower. Suddenly, a second hand thrusts into the frame, 
onto her nightgown.
A bloody hand.
A hand from the earth itself.
Carrie's hand.
It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist. Tightly. A vise.
Sue begins screaming uncontrollably. The hand is trying to 
pull her into the ground. Her screams turn into howling.
CUT TO:
SUE --
Still screaming. But now in her room, ’waking up from what 
is, indeed, a bad nightmare. Upright in bed, screaming her 
head off, her face covered with perspiration.
Eleanor Snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her 
hysterical daughter.
ELEANOR
It’s all right, it’s all right 
darling.
SUE
125.
Mother?
And we come in close on Sue's stricken face as her mother 
holds her, calming her, cradling her. Closer still on Sue's 
eyes. She closes them, and we go to
BLACK.
