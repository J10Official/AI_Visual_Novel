An OLD MAN in khakis works at section of mound with 
excavating pick. (In b.g. there may be TWO KURDISH ASSISTANTS 
carefully packing the day's finds.) The old man now makes a 
find. He extracts it gingerly from the mound, begins to dust 
it off then reacts with dismay upon recognizing a green stone 
amulet in the figure of the demon Pazuzu.
CLOSE SHOT - PERSPIRATION POURING DOWN OLD MAN'S BROW
CLOSE SHOT - OLD MAN'S HANDS
Trembling, they reach across rude wooden table and cup 
themselves around a steaming glass of hot tea, as if for 
warmth.
CLOSE SHOT - OLD MAN’S FACE
The eyes staring off, haunted, as if by some chilling 
premonition — and some frightening remembrance.

SUPERIMPOSE: NORTHERN IRAQ. The chaykhana (teahouse) is set 
among poppied, green hills and athwart a ragged, rock-strewn 
bolt of road. In the background, the beautiful mound-city of 
Erbil floats upward, scraping the cloud. The KURDISH 
PROPRIETOR is seen leaning in the Chaykhana doorway. He 
watches the only other character visible, the OLD MAN, who 
sits at an outdoor table, inexplicably cold beneath the fiery 
sun. Abstractedly, he sips at his tea. Nearby, parked off the 
road, an ancient jeep. LOSE SUPER. The Proprietor shuffles 
out, stands beside the Old Man, speaks to him in Kurdish 
indistinctly. The Old Man appears not to hear at first; then 
comes to, looks up at Kurd, shakes head mutely, and reaches 
into shirt pocket, removing coins to pay for his tea.
CLOSE SHOT - COINS SLIPPED ONTO TABLE
CLOSE SHOT - IGNITION KEY IN JEEP

The Old Man's hand reaches into FRAME, starts engine. The 
jeep takes off, disappearing down the road. The Kurd comes 
into FRAME, and we end CLOSE on him as he watches the jeep. 
Mirrored in his face are sadness; love; respect.

The CAMERA is in notion, SLOHLY PANNING the tagged finds of a 
recent archeological dig now spread out in near rows on a 
long table. The CAMERA STOPS finally at an Assyrian pendant 
as the CURATOR'S HAND reaches INTO FRAME, lifting tag on 
pendant so that-the writing on it can be read by him. The 
only SOUND is the soft, regular TICKING of an old-fashioned 
pendulum CLOCK.
CLOSE SHOT - LEDGER
containing entries of the finds. It is clearly headed (in the 
Curator's handwriting) "Nineveh Excavation: Merrin." On a 
fresh line of the entries, Curator's hand now writes: 
"Pendant, Assyrian; Palace of Assurbani -- " Here, the hand 
breaks off.
CLOSE SHOT - ARAB CURATOR
He is seated at same table on which rest the finds and is 
looking up curiously from ledger at someone O.S.
CLOSE SHOT - OLD MAN
He is standing over another section of the same table.
He is staring down at something on it. O.S.
CLOSE SHOT - AMULET ON TABLE
Tagged, it is the Pazuzu amulet.
CLOSE SHOT - CURATOR
His gaze is now on the amulet. Softly:
CURATOR
Evil against evil.
INTERCUT OLD HAM AND CURATOR
The Old Man does not react, continuing to stare down at 
amulet, expression haunted. After a beat:
CURATOR:
Father?
3.
We are on the Old Man now as, after several beats, the 
TICKING of the CLOCK abruptly ceases; and it is this sudden 
silence that, after a beat, unconsciously causes the Old Man 
to look up at the Curator, who is still staring at the Old 
Man. Still no response. Something is worrying the Curator, 
but he doesn't know what.
CURATOR: (ARABIC)
My heart has a wish: That you would 
not go, old friend.
OLD MAN: (ARABIC)
I have an errand.
AT CURATOR - OLD MAN
They stand by open door to street, the Old Man leaving.
Curator has hold of Old Man’s hand in both of his. He is 
troubled, as if the Old Nan’s premonition has invaded him. 
The Old Man slowly looks up at Curator, searching his face 
with great affection. Then, with a squeeze of his hand:
OLD MAN
Goodbye.

The Old Man exits, leaving FRAME as he steps into the 
gathering gloom of the streets of Mosul. The Curator watches 
him, great love in his expression as:
P.O.V. THE OLD MAN STREET OUTSIDE CURATOR’S OFFICE
The Old Man almost collides with a fast-moving droshky.
CLOSE MOVING SHOT - DROSHKY’S SOLE PASSENGER
A corpulent, OLD ARAB NOMAN in black, her face a shadow 
behind the lace veil draped loosely over her like a shroud.

An Arab watchman approaches, rifle at the ready; but then 
stops and waves as he recognizes the Old Man.
MOVING SHOT
as the Old Man slowly resumes his walk with the manner of 
someone sifting vibrations. He is like one*looking for 
something, yet is afraid that he will find it. At last, upon 
seeing something O.S., he freezes.
P.O.V. - FULL SHOT - STATUE OF DEMON PAZUZU IN SITU
AT OLD MAN
This is it. He lowers head, closing eyes against a dread 
confirmation of his premonition. A SHADOW of the statue 
lengthens and creeps onto Old Man’s face as in the distance 
we HEAR the Dili YAPPINGS of SAVAGE DOG EACKS.
ANGLE AT SHADOWS QUICKENING ACROSS THE DESERT
Still the DOGS, yelping and howling distantly. A breeze rises 
up, blowing dust and sand ACROSS THE FRAME.
AT OLD MAN
He slowly lifts his head, his gaze on the O.S. statue of 
Pazuzu. But in his expression now is acceptance and grim 
determination. The shadow on his face has grown longer and 
the breeze is whipping gently at his shirt.
OLD MAN’S P.O.V. - STATUE OF PA2UZU

SOUND of savage dogs gives way to DISTANT SOUNDS of friendly

Below us, the Potomac River; the Gothic spires and wooded 
walks of Georgetown University; a PRIEST or two walking, 
saying their Office; and then, we are on Prospect Street 
slowly approaching a house that sits beside a flight of 
steep, stone steps plunging precipitately down to "M" Street 
below. An upstairs bedroom light is burning.

CHRIS is sitting up in bed. Her lips move silently as she 
studies lines from a film script. We HEAR light O.S. RAPPING 
SOUNDS, irregular, yet rhythmically clustered. They sound 
like alien code tapped out by a dead man.
Chris HEARS them, listens for a moment, then tries to ignore 
them, but she cannot concentrate. She irritably slams script 
down and bounces out of bed. She EXITS into:
SECOND FLOOR HALL - MACNEIL HOUSE - DAWN
The RAPPINGS are louder. Chris listens for source of sound; 
locates it; throws open door to Regan's bedroom.

The RAPPINGS have abruptly ceased. Chris looks baffled.
P.O.V. - THE ROOM - CAMERA SHIFTING
to follow Chris' scrutiny. It is a typical child’s bedroom. 
A. large bay window; with shutters overlooks the steps 
outside the house. REGAN is asleep, her blankets kicked off 
and askew. Chris moves to bedside.
Heavy breathing, regular and deep. Chris considers; then 
abruptly notices goose pimples on her arms. She rubs at them, 
shivering as if at an icy coldness. She touches the nearby 
radiator. Hot. She looks at Regan, frowning in perplexity, 
for Regan's brow is wet with perspiration. Chris squints her 
eyes in consternation; looks back at her goose pimples. Now 
she hears SOUNDS from above, like tiny claws scratching at 
the edge of a galaxy. She looks up at ceiling. The SCRAPINGS 
cease.
Chris keeps staring a moment, then looks down. She leans 
over, adjusts Regan's pillow, then examines her features with 
warmth.
CHRIS
(whisper)
I sure do love you.

CHRIS
(o.s.)
Hi, Willie. Howya doin’?
FULL SHOT - KITCHEN - CHRIS - WILLIE
WILLIE, a middle-aged housekeeper, is at stove. Sleepy-eyed 
Chris, in bathrobe and carrying script, is entering. Willie 
hastily puts down fork, wiping hands on dish towel as:
WILLIE
(German accent)
Oh, Mrs. MacNeil! Good morning!
As Willie moves for coffee pot, Chris is ahead of her.
CHRIS
Never mind, Will, I’ll get it.
She drops a pack of cigarettes and matches beside her cup and 
sits. Crusty-eyed, she picks up copy of Washington Post by 
plate and stares at it fuddled until she realizes it is 
upside down. She turns it right-side up. A man enters: KARL. 
Willie's husband. Very Teutonic. He is carrying a Spark 
left's bottle to mount on cooler in exchange for the empty.
KARL:
Good morning, Madam.
CHRIS:
(LIGHTS CIGARETTE)
Mornin'. Hey, Karl, we've got rats 
in the attic. Better get us some 
traps.
KARL:
There are rats?
CHRIS:
I just said that.
KARL:
But the attic is clean.
CHRIS:
Well, okay, we've got clean rats.
KARL:
No rats.
7.
CHRIS:
Karl, I heard them this morning!
KARL:
Maybe plumbing. Maybe boards.
CHRIS:
Maybe rats! Now will you buy the 
damn traps and quit arguing?
KARL:
(leaving quickly)
Yes. I go now.
CHRIS:
No, not now, Karl! The stores are 
all closed.
KARL:
I will see.
CHRIS:
Karl -- !
He is gone. Chris and Millie exchange exasperated glances, 
and then we HEAR FRONT DOOR OREN AND CLOSE, o.s. With a sigh, 
Willie turns back to bacon, shaking her head.
WILLIE:
They are closed.
EXT. CAMPUS OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY - DAY

A film is being shot in front the steps of Healy Building.
The usual equipment, cast and crew are in evidence, as well 
as spectators made up of faculty and students.
Chris, in jeans and sweatshirt, and indicating page in her 
script (titled "CRASH COURSE”), calls her director, elfin 
British BURNS DENNINGS. He has been drinking.
Swigging from a paper cup, he looks over as, argumentatively:
CHRIS:
Hey, Burke? Take a look at damned 
thing, will ya?
DENNINGS:
Oh, how marvelous! You do have a 
script, I see!
8.
(he surgically shaves a 
narrow strip from edge of 
page of her script)
Yes, how nice! I believe I'll just 
have a little fiddle.
As they continue, Burke will nervously fiddle with the paper, 
in the meantime:
CHRIS:
Burke —
DENNINGS:
Yes, I'm terribly glad that the 
star has a script. Now then, tell 
me my baby: What is it? What's 
wrong?
CHRIS:
(indicating script)
It just doesn’t make sense.
DENNINGS:
(lying)
Why, it's perfectly plain. You're a 
teacher at the college and you 
don't want the building torn down 
and —
CHRIS:
Oh, well, Jesus, Burke; thanks; I 
can read.
DENNINGS:
Then what's wrong?
CHRIS:
Why the hell should they tear down 
the building?
DENNINGS:
Are you sending me up?
CHRIS:
No, I*m asking 'what for?'
DENNINGS:
Because it's there!
CHRIS:
In the script?
DENNINGS:
9.
(suppressing drunken 
giggle)
On the grounds!
CHRIS:
Well, it doesn’t make sense. They 
wouldn’t do that.
DENNINGS:
They would!
CHRIS:
No, they wouldn't!
DENNING:
Shall we summon the writer? I 
believe he’s in Paris!
CHRIS:
Hiding?
DENNINGS:
Fucking! Now then, shall we get on 
with it?
Chris stares momentarily, then sags onto Burke spurting 
laughter. Then she looks worriedly toward a PRIEST (KARRAS) 
O.S. among the spectators, afraid he’s heard obscenity. And 
now we CUT TO Karras and see that he is smiling slightly but 
warmly. The ANGIE then RETURNS to Chris, Burke and the A.D.
DENNINGS:
I said, "Shall we get on with it?"
CHRIS:
Huh? Yeah, okay, Burke. Let’s go.
DENNINGS:
(at A.D.)
All right, lights, love.
ASST. DIRECTOR
Let's warm ’em!
DENNINGS:
(to A.D.)
Now the extras should be ...
And we HEAR the AD LIB continuation O.S. a bit as CAMERA now 
FOLLOWS Chris as she walks, head down, concentrating while 
crew sets up. Then she looks over toward Karras.
10.
He’s gone. She sees him walking slowly away toward the campus 
gates like a lone black cloud in search of the rain. Dennings 
comes to Chris.
CHRIS:
Are you ready, ducks?
CHRIS:
Do it.
DENNINGS:
Roll the film.
ASST. DIRECTOR:
Okay, roll 'er.
TECHNICIAN:
Speed.
DENNINGS:
Action!
While extras cheer and boo at her approach, Chris races up 
Healy Steps and seizes bullhorn from REEEL STUDENT LEADER. 
There is pushing and shoving. POLICE are on the scene.
CHRIS:
(through bullhorn)
Okay, now, hold it! Hold it a 
second!
(as the commotion 
continues)
Hey, give me a chance, will *ya, 
huh? Just a minute?
We see now that various of the student factions are holding 
up signs and banners. Some read: "KEEP CLASSES OPEN", "FREE 
LOGIC!", "SHUT DOWN!", "CLOSE THE SCHOOL" and "BURN IT!?" 
Still other placards are blank. Many of the students in one 
sector are affecting shrouds and death masks. As the 
commotion diminishes;
CHRIS:
Look, we're all concerned with 
human rights, but the kids who pay 
tuition have also got a right, the 
right to learn, and shutting those 
kids out of class solves nothing. 
It's answering one kind of tyranny 
with another, one kind of cruelty 
with another.
11.
Commotion. At some point during the above speech, we will 
hear Chris O. S. while the CAMERA GOES to Dennings as the 
director turns a significant and imperious gaze to the A.D., 
who dutifully pads over to him and proffers his open script 
like an aging altar boy the missal to his priest at solemn 
Hass. Burke begins to slice off a strip of page.

It has clouded over, threatening rain. Chris, wearing 
raincoat, sends limo driver home.
CHRIS:
I feel like walking, Tommy. Thanks.
He nods. She starts to walk home, thoughtful and weary.
As she walks by Holy Trinity Auditorium, a YOUNG PRIEST in 
nylon windbreaker passes her. Tense. He takes a right into an 
easement leading into a courtyard back of church. Chris 
pauses by easement, watching him; curious.
He heads for white frame cottage from which an OLDER PRIEST 
emerges looking glum and nervous. He nods curtly toward the 
Younger Priest, and with lowered eyes heads for door to back 
of church. Again, cottage door opens from within and Karras 
appears. He silently greets the Younger Priest, putting his 
arm around his shoulder as he leads him inside, a gesture 
that is gentle and somehow parental. Door closes and they are 
gene. Chris is pensive, puzzled by the scene. A RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER. She looks up at the sky, tugging up raincoat collar.

We open on SHARON SPENCER, a pretty young blonde and Chris’ 
secretary (and nurse to Regan) sitting at break­ fast table, 
typing. Stack of mail and messages. Me HEAR front door close; 
FOOTSTEPS approaching. Chris enters, weary.
SHARON:
(continuing to type)
Hi, Chris. How’d it go?
CHRIS:
Oh, well, it was kind of like the 
Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi 
Minh story, but other than that it 
was really terrific.
12.
Chris has come to table, stands leafing through mail and 
messages. Sharon continues to type through:
CHRIS:
Anything exciting?
SHARON:
Do you want to have dinner next 
week at the White House?
CHRIS:
Are you kidding?
SHARON:
No, of course not; it’s Thursday.
CHRIS:
Big party?
SHARON:
No, I gather it’s just five or six 
people.
CHRIS:
(back to table, sifting 
mail and messages)
No kidding? Where's Rags?
SHARON
Oh, she’s down in the playroom.
CHRIS:
What doin'?
SHARON:
She's sculpting. She’s making you a 
bird.
CHRIS:
How’d the lesson go?
SHARON:
(frowning)
Bad time with math again.
CHRIS:
Oh? Gee, that’s funny.
SHARON:
I know. It's her favorite subject.
CHRIS

Oh, well, this "new math'." Christ, 
I couldn’t make change for the bus 
if --
She is interrupted by the bounding entrance of REGAN, her 11-
year-old daughter. Freckles. Ponytails. Braces on teeth. Arms 
outstretched, she is racing for her mother.
REGAN:
Hi, Mom!
She is in SCENE not? as Chris catches her in a bear hug.
'Sharon resumes her typing.
CHRIS:
Hiya, bearface!
Chris covers her with smacking kisses. Then, rocking her back 
and forth:
CHRIS:
What ’djya do today? Anything 
exciting?
REGAN:
Oh, stuff.
CHRIS:
So, what kind of stuff?
REGAN
Oh, well, I studied, and I painted.
CHRIS:
Wha'djya paint?
REGAN:
Oh, well, flowers. Ya' know, 
daisies? An' — Oh! Mother! This 
horse!
(excited; eyes widening)
This man had a horse, ya know, down 
by the river? We were talking, see. 
Mom, and then-along came this 
horse! He was beautiful! Oh, Mom, 
ya should've seen him, and the man 
let me sit on him! Really! I mean, 
practically a minute! It was a gray 
horse! Mother, can't we get a 
horse? I mean could we?
CHRIS:
We’ll see, baby.
14.
REGAN:
Gee, Mom, I’m starving.
CHRIS:
Run upstairs and get dressed and 
we'll go out for some pizza.
She races upstairs.
REGAN:
Can I wear my new dress?
CHRIS:
Honey, sure.
(at Sharon)
Got a date?
SHARON:
Yes, I do.
CHRIS:
You go on, then.
(indicating mail)
We can catch all this stuff in the 
morning.
Sharon rises, but Chris abruptly recollects something.
CHRIS:
Oh, hey, wait. There's a letter got 
to go out tonight.
SHARON:
(reaching for dictation 
pad)
Oh, okay.
Chris starts to dictate:
CHRIS:
Dear Mr. Gable...
Sharon reacts, amused; then Chris dictates in earnest: a 
letter to her agent. As she gets into it:
REGAN:
(o.s.)
Moth-theeeeeerrrr! I can’t find the 
dress!
CHRIS:
(starting out)
Shar, wait’ll I come down.

SHARON:

Gee, it’s time for me to meditate, 
Chris.
CHRIS:

exasperation)
You really think that kind of stuff 
if going to do you any good?
SHARON:
Well, it gives me peace of mind.
CHRIS:

Right.
She turns away and starts to exit.

Began looks unconvinced. She looks up at ceiling again; then 
moves over to watch her mother’s search for the dress which 
now ends in apparent failure.
REGAN:

TOM:

They stop.
KARRAS:

Some of their problems core down to 
vocation, to the meaning of their

Regan is standing by a games table in basement made over as 
playroom, and hands her a sculpted clay "worry bird” with a 
comically long painted nose. Chris oohs and ahhs.
REGAN:

Oh, honey, I do, I really do. Got a 
name for it?
REGAN:
Uh-uh.
CHRIS:
What’s a good one?
REGAN:

I dunno.
CHRIS:

Let me see, let me see. I don’t 
know. Nhaddya think? Whaddya think 
about ’Durbbird?' Huh? Just

Yep.

You know how?

Oh, well, sure. Here, I'll show

Well, I think you need two people,

No, ya don’t, Mora. I do it all the

opposite)
Oh, you do? Hell, let’s both play, 
okay?
REGAN:
Well -- okay.

Regan has her fingertips positioned on the planchette, and as 
Chris reaches out to put hers there, planchette makes sudden, 
forceful move to the position on board.
CHRIS:
You don’t want me to play?
REGAN:
No, I do! Captain Howdy said ”No."
CHRIS:
Captain who?
REGAN:
Captain Howdy.
CHRIS:
Honey, who’s Captain Howdy?
REGAN:
Oh, ya know. I make questions and 
he does the answers.
CHRIS:
That’s so?
REGAN:
Oh, he's nice.
CHRIS:
Oh, well, sure; he’s terrific.

Regan stares at board, eyes drawn tight in concentration.
REGAN:

is pretty?
Seconds tick by. nothing happening. Chris turns head at an 
odd, o.s. CREAKING SOUND from closet area. She holds the look

a page. Regan, half asleep, enters.
CHRIS:
Hi, honey. What’s wrong?
REGAN:
There's these real funny noises, 
Mom. It’s like knocking. I can’t go 
to sleep.
CHRIS:
(struggling up)
Oh, where the heck are those traps!
REGAN:
Huh?
Chris takes her hand, leading her out of study.
CHRIS:
Oh, nothing, hon. Come on. You can

REGAN:
I can’t find it. Can I watch?
CHRIS:

Sure, okay.

Loud enough?
REGAN:
Yes.
CHRIS:

Door is pushed slowly open. Chris ENTERS, tries the light 
switch. It doesn't work. She looks about the attic searching 
for something while slowly advancing at CAMERA when the 
candle flame suddenly and astoundingly disengages from the 
candle and shoots up to the ceiling and is extinguished. 
Behind Chris, having come upstairs, looms KARL. Coning up 
silently behind Chris:
KARL:
There is nothing.
On the "Nothing," Chris leaps three feet out of her skin and 
emits a YELP of startled fright, spinning around and 
practically into Karl's arms. A hand to her fluttering heart:
CHRIS:
Oh, good Jesus! Oh, jesus h. 
Christ, Karl, don’t do that!
KARL:
Very sorry. But you see? No rats.
CHRIS:
Yeah, no rats. Thanks a lot, Karl. 
Terrific.
KARL:
(exiting.)
Madam, maybe cat better.
CHRIS:
What?
KARL:
Maybe cat better — to catch rats.
He EXITS. Chris stares a moment, then releases a sigh of 
weariness and relief.

They stare mutely. Regan has turned sad. After a few beats:
REGAN:
Mom, why do people have to die?
Chris looks at her. She doesn’t know how to answer.
Finally:
CHRIS:
(tenderly)
Honey, people get tired.
REGAN:
Why does God let then?
CHRIS:

Who’s been telling you about God, 
baby?
REGAN:
Sharon.
CHRIS:
Oh.

We HEAR key in door from other side. The PASTOR of Holy 
Trinity sluggishly enters, sets door stop to hold door open, 
turns on church lights, blows nose into handkerchief as he 
absently shuffles along; then genuflects at altar railing. He 
blesses himself, says a silent prayer, and as he looks up and 
starts to bless himself he. reacts with startlement and then 
shock as he sees before him;
P.O.V. STATUE OF BLESSED VIRGIN AT SIDE ALTAR
It has been desecrated, painted over to suggest that the 
Virgin is a harlot. A slatternly, dissolute appearance.
And glued to the appropriate spot is a sculpted clay phallus 
in erection.
INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION

Silence, except for low RUMBLE of distant train. Points of 
light stretch down the darkness of the tunnel like guides to 
hopelessness.
ANGLE AT PLATFORM - MAN
The station appears to be deserted. The MAN stands close to 
the edge of the near platform. Black coat, hat and trousers. 
Powerfully built. He carries a valise resembling a doctor’s 
medical bag and stands with his back to us, head down, as if 
in dejection. Hear him, a vending machine on a pillar.
WIDE ANGLE - PLATFORM
27.
DERELICT:
Faddah.
An old DERELICT lies drunk, his back against station wall.
DERELICT:
Hey, Faddah! Couldja help an old 
altar boy, Faddah? I’m Cat’lic.
The Man looks up with dismay, disclosing the round Roman 
collar at the neck, and the face of Damien Karras, now filled 
with an even deeper pain than when we met him.
He shuts his eyes against this intrusion and clutches at his 
coat lapels, nulling them together as if to hide the collar. 
The train SOUND is UP FULL NOW, and in ANOTHER ANGLE the 
TRAIN rushes across FRAME, blocking our view of Karras and 
the Derelict.
EXT. HIGH SHOT - EAST 21ST STREET IN N.Y.C. - DAY
45

Between 1st and 2nd Avenues. Karras walks despondently along 
the south side of the street, which is studded with decrepit 
tenement buildings. He pauses before one and with melancholy 
sees his past in the raggedly clothed, grime-covered, foul-
mouthed urchins pitching pennies against the stoop. Karras 
looks up at front door. He starts up the steps.
INT. HALL - KARRAS OUTSIDE MOTHER’S APARTMENT DOOR

CUTTING, we find the CAMERA stationed by an apartment front 
door, trained on Karras mounting steps at far end of hall. He 
approaches and lightly raps. From within we HEAR faint SOUND 
of a RADIO tuned to news station.
Karras waits a moment, then digs out a key from pants pocket, 
opens door like an aching wound, and enters.
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY
46
46
The RADIO now more audible. We are in a railroad flat 
kitchen. Tiny. Cracking plaster and peeling wallpaper. 
Unkempt. Sparse and ancient furnishings. In the kitchen, a 
snail tub for bathing. Faded old newspapers spread on the 
uncarpeted floor. As Karras enters, he breathes in an aching 
sigh as his gaze brushes around at the painful reminders of 
his past. Then he glances to right, from which we HEAR SOUHD 
of RADIO. He puts down valise and starts into bedroom.
KARRAS:
Mama?
28.
No response. CAMERA FOLLOWS him into squalid living room. 
Karras now sees his MOTHER, fully dressed, sleeping on a torn 
and grease-stained old sofa. On her right cheek, a prominent 
mole. He observes her for a moment; sighs as he removes 
raincoat.
As he drapes it over a chair, his mother awakens with a 
slight start; sees him; reacts with surprise and joy.
Speaking with a thick Mediterranean accent:
MOTHER:
Dimmy!
She hastily gets to feet and throws arms around Karras.
MOTHER:
Oh, Dimmy, I so glad to see you!
INT. KARRAS' MOTHER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Me HEAR radio still tuned to news. Karras and mother sit at 
tiny table in kitchen. Karras sips at coffee. His mother 
drinks in his presence as:

I fix for you.
KARRAS:
No, Mom.
MOTHER:

Karras looks saddened.
INT. MOTHER’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother (wearing holy medal) sits on sofa, watching as Karras 
repairs a broken lamp. The room has been tidied up a little. 
In the scene we SEE a broom, a small plastic refuse container 
and a dilapidated carpet sweeper. Silence. Then:
MOTHER:
Dimmy, you worry about something?
KARRAS:
No, Mama.
MOTHER:
You not happy. What's the matter, 
Dimmy?
KARRAS:
Nothing, Mama. Really. I’m fine.
A pause. Then:
MOTHER:
(o.s.)
I wish you was marry Mary McArdle.
CLOSE SHOT
silently watching; thinking.
ANOTHER ANGLE - (TIME PASSAGE)
Karras is entering living room, pulling on raincoat. He has 
valise. He cones to Mother and observes her sadly for a 
moment. Regret. He leans over and kisses her cheek tenderly. 
He starts to leave, remembers something, tunes radio to all-
news station.

'I will go to the Altar of God, 
Unto God who gives joy to my 
youth.'
IHT. HALL OF BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - DAY
56
56
The CAMERA is fixed at one end of the hall, and Karras and 
his UNCLE are approaching from far down the opposite end; 
however, their dialogue is clearly audible at all times, and 
their voices metallically reverberant.
Karras has his head down, sorrowful and displayed, as he 
listens to the Uncle, who speaks with a thick, immigrant 
accent. Karras is ruefully shaking his head, and the UNCLE is 
gesturing helplessly, defensively, as:
UNCLE:
But, Dimmy, da edema affected her 
brain! You understand? She don't 
let. any doctor come near her! She 
was all da time screwin', even 
talkin' to da radio! Listen, 
regular hospital not gonna nut up

Dimmy. Two or t’ree month, and 
she’s out, good as new.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Karras and his Uncle have halted outside locked door above 
which is posted the legend: NEURO-PSYCHIATRIC: WARD 3, and 
Uncle pushes BUZZER to summon curse.
UNCLE:
You go in, Dimmy. I wait out here.
Karras nods. Now the uncle has head down in ironic thought.
UNCLE:
Cat’s funny. You know, if you

psychiatrist now on Park Avenue, 
Dimmy. Your mother, she be livin’

as a corpulent NURSE waddles INTO FRAME and uses large iron 
key to unlock door. O.S., we HEAR the demented SCREAMS, MOANS 
and FRAGMENTED STATEMENTS of MENTAL PATIENTS. The door comes 
open, disclosing Karras and Uncle. Karras slowly lifts head 
at the O.S. SOUNDS.
INT. WARD 3 INVALIDED PATIENTS’ ROOM

Karras walks down aisle of an enormous ward containing eighty 
beds. The PATIENTS are mostly elderly, and we HEAR their 
CRIES of PAIN and DEMENTED CHATTER. Karras stops before a 
bedded patient far down the row; Karras' MOTHER. Gaunt and 
hollow-eyed, looking confused and helpless; disoriented; she 
has spied her son and is gripping at sidebars of bed, trying 
to raise herself as CAMERA now moves forward, again, trained 
on mother.
By the time Karras halts by her, his mother, looking 
frightened and pathetic, eyes wide with pleading, has raised 
herself up, pulling weakly, hands trembling.
MOTHER
Why you do dis, Dimmy? Why?
INT. BELLEVUE HALL - KARRAS AND UNCLE WALKING

Behind them, WAPD 3 entry door. Karras is fumbling for his 
cigarette pack. His eyes are wet with tears.

Klein administering physical to Regan. Should include 
ophthalmoscope, tuning fork and simple coordination test. 
Also blood sample in centridograph, and urine sample under 
microscope. FINAL SHOT has a NURSE leaning with her back 
against examining table, her expression partly puttied, 
partly disturbed as she observes Regan, who is in her slip 
and in constant motion; stepping, twirling, touching, making 
nervous movements while aimlessly humming. Klein is not 
present.
INT. DR. KLEIN’S OFFICE - DAY
64
64
Chris is seated on edge of chair. Klein is back of desk, 
writing a prescription.
KLEIN:
A disorder of the nerves. At least 
we think it is. We don’t know yet 
exactly how it works, but it’s 
often seen in early adolescence. 
She shows all the symptoms: the 
hyperactivity; the temper; her 
performance in math.
CHRIS:
Yeah, the math. Why the math?
KLEIN:­
It affects concentration.
(he rips the prescription 
from the small blue pad 
and hands it over)
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten 
milligrams a day.
CHRIS:
(eyes prescription)
What is it? A tranquilizer?
KLEIN:
A stimulant.
CHRIS:
Stimulant? She’s higher'n a kite 
right now!
KLEIN:
33.
Her condition isn't quite what it 
seems. Nobody knows the cause of 
hyperkinetic behavior in a child. 
The Ritalin seems to work to 
relieve the condition but we really 
don’t know how or why, frankly. 
Your daughter's symptoms could be 
an overreaction to depression -- 
but that's out of my field.
CHRIS:
Depression?
KLEIN:
Well, you mentioned her father ... 
the separation.
CHRIS:
Do you think I should take her to 
see a psychiatrist?
KLEIN:
Oh, no. I'd wait and see what 
happens with the Ritalin. I think 
that’s the answer. Wait two or 
three weeks.
CHRIS:
And those lies she's been telling?
KLEIN:
Lies?
CHRIS:
Ya know, those things to get 
attention, like saying that her bed 
shakes and stuff.
KLEIN:
Have you ever known your daughter 
to swear and use obscenities?
CHRIS:
Never.
KLEIN:
Well, you see, that’s quite similar 
to things like her lying — 
uncharacter —
CHRIS:
(interrupting; perplexed)
Wait a minute. What are you talking 
about?
34.
KLEIN:
Well, she let loose quite a string 
while I was examining her, Mrs. 
MacNeil.
CHRIS:
You’re kidding! Like what?
KLEIN:
(looking evasive)
Well, I’d say her vocabulary's 
rather extensive.
CHRIS:
Well, what, for example? I mean, 
give me a for instance!
Klein shrugs. No reply.
CHRIS:
Hey, come on; I’m grown-up. What’d 
she say? I mean specifically, 
Doctor.
KLEIN:
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, 
she advised me to keep my fingers 
away from her "goddam cunt."
CHRIS:
(shocked.)
She used those words?
KLEIN:
She used those words. Look, I doubt 
that she even understood what she 
was saying.
CHRIS:
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't 
think a psychiatrist?
KLEIN:
The best explanation is always the 
simplest one. Let's wait. Let’s 
wait and see.
(smiling encouragingly)
In the meantime, try not to worry.
CHRIS:
How?

PROGRESS - NIGHT

A few Jesuits and some of the cast and crew of the motion 
picture are present. Vibrant hum of conversation. Then a 
CLOSER ANGLE featuring Burke Dennings. Burke, an empty glass 
in hand, stands chatting with silver-maned SENATOR and 
SENATOR'S WIFE. Back of them, and to side. Chris is visible, 
chatting with the Jesuit DEALT of the college.
Karl is approaching the latter with drinks tray. Burke seems 
irritable and tautly drunk.
DENNINGS:
Ho, no, her part is finished; all 
the parts with the principal 
actors, you see; but I’m staying to 
finish other scenes.
SENATOR:
I understand.
Karl has approached Burke's group.
DENNINGS:
Oh, how splendid,
(reaching for a fresh 
drink)
Let's another for the road.
CHRIS:
(brief over-the-shoulder 
at Dennings)
The Lincoln Highway?
DENNINGS:
(at Chris)
Oh, now, don’t be so silly.
SENATOR’S WIFE:
(at Chris)
Fun party.
CHRIS:
(at wife)
Thanks, Martha.
And Chris returns to conversation with the Dean. During the 
above, the Senator has mutely refused another drink, but 
Burke now takes one in his other hand as well as:
DENNINGS:
(at Karl)
36.
Oh, now tell me, was it Public 
Relations you did for the Gestapo, 
or Community Relations?
KARL:
(grimly uptight)
I am Swiss.
DENNINGS:
Yes, of course. And you never went 
bowling with Goebbels, I suppose.
FRONT TRACKING SHOT - KARL
His face impassive; yet his eyes are angry, as we HEAR:
DENNINGS:
(at Karl as latter moves 
on)
So superior, aren't you? Nazi!
CAMERA FOLLOWS Karl but holds — as he passes them — on Sharon 
and MARY JO FERRIN, who are seated somewhere in the room. A 
bubbly personality, Mary Jo is reading Sharon’s palm.
PERRIN:
Well yes, your work line is longer 
than your heart line. There, you 
see? And you've recently broken, up 
with a boyfriend. Am I right?
SHARON:
No.
PERRIN
I'm really famous for predictions, 
not palms.
(dropping Sharon's palm)
Where’s the bathroom?
SHARON:
(rising)
Upstairs, I’ll go with you.
As they move, CAMERA FOLLOWS:
PERRIN:
Oh, by the way, I brought that 
witchcraft book you asked for.
SHARON:
Oh, thanks.
PERRIN:
37.
And another one on Russian ESP, 
They’re in the study.
They walk out of frame as CAMERA HOLDS on Dennings, the 
Senator, and his wife. The Senator is turned away from 
Dennings, conversing in low tones with wife. Dennings is now 
composed and as he stares down into his gin glass:
DENNINGS:
There seems to be an alien pubic-
hair in my gin.
SENATOR:
(turning to Dennings, as 
his wife splits)
I beg your pardon?
DENNINGS:
(defensive)
Never seen it before in my life!
SENATOR
(a murmur)
Yes, I’m sure.
DENNINGS:
(now accusatory)
Have you?
ANGLE AT CHRIS, JESUIT DEAN, MARY JO PERRIn
Mary Jo is seated on sofa with Jesuit Dean. Chris is on floor 
in front of coffee table facing then, as all eat dinner.
PERRIN:
On, cone on, every family's got one 
black sheep.
DEAN:
Yes, I know, but we were pushing 
our quota with the Medici Popes.
CHRIS:
Say, Father, there's something I've 
been meaning to ask you. Do you 
know that sort of wing that's in 
back of the church over there? The 
red brick one, I mean.
(pointing in direction)
DEAN:
St. Mike's.
CHRIS:
38.
Yeah, right. St. Mike's. What goes 
on in there, Father?
DEAN
Oh, that's where we say Black Mass.
CHRIS:
(as Perrin chuckles)
What’s that?
PERRIN:
Oh, he's kidding.
CHRIS:
I wasn't. I'd still like to know 
what it is.
DEAN
Oh, well basically, I guess, it's a 
travesty of the Catholic Mass. It's 
connected to witchcraft. Devil 
worship cults.
(looking around for 
someone)
Gee, where's Joe? He knows all 
about this stuff.
He is indicating Father Dyer, who is standing at buffet, 
heaping second helping onto his plate.
DEAN:
Hey, Joe!
DYER:
(turning)
You called, Great Dean?
Dean beckons him over.
DEAN:
(to Chris)
They had a couple of cases of 
desecration in Holy Trinity last 
week, and Joe said something about 
one of them reminding him of some 
things they used to do at Black 
Mass, so I expect he knows 
something about the subject.
PERRIN:
What happened at the church?
DEAN:
Oh, it’s really too disgusting.
39.
DYER:
Listen, give me just a minute. I 
think I've got something going over 
there with the Astronaut.
DEAN:
What?
DYER:
(raising eyebrows)
First missionary on the moon?
They burst into laughter as he moves off to join ASTRONAUT.
CHRIS:
He’s fun.
(at Dean)
You haven't told me what goes on 
yet in back of St. Mike’s. Big 
secret? Who’s that priest I keep 
seeing there? You know, sort of 
dark? Do you know the one I mean?
DEAN:
(lowered tone; trace of 
regret)
Father Karras.
CHRIS:
What’s he do?
DEAN:
He’s our counselor, Chris. A 
psychiatrist. The back of St. 
Mike’s is our couch.
CHRIS:
Oh, I see.
DEAN:
Had a pretty rough knock last 
night, poor guy. His mother passed 
away.
CHRIS:
(sensation of grief)
Oh, I’m sorry.
DEAN:
He seems to be taking it pretty 
hard. She was living by herself, 
and I guess she was dead for a 
couple of days before they found 
her.
40.
PERRIN:
(murmur)
Oh, how awful.
DEAN:
The superintendent of her apartment 
building found her at four in the 
morning. They wouldn’t have found 
her even then except ... Well, the 
next door neighbors complained 
about her radio going all the time.
TWO SHOT - DYER AND ASTRONAUT

Chris is bursting in as Dennings continues to rave at a 
stolid, expressionless Karl who stands immobile, arms akimbo, 
watching Dennings.
DENNINGS:
Cunting Hun! You bloody damned 
butchering Nazi pig!
CHRIS:
(over Dennings)
Karl! Will you get out of here! Get 
out!
Sharon enters now and Chris has started pushing Karl out. The 
latter, defiant, permits it only reluctantly.
DENNINGS:
What the hell makes you think 
you're so fucking superior? 
Goddamned cunting Heinrich Himmler! 
Get the hell back to — !
Karl is out and now Dennings, in a remarkable performance, is 
instantly composed and as Chris turns to him after shoving 
Karl out door, Dennings turns to her genially and rubs his 
hands together with:
DENNINGS:
Now, then, what's dessert?
41.
CHRIS:
Dessert!
DENNINGS:

Well, I'm hungry.
Chris reacts, incredulous and exasperated, then turns and 
exits. Passing Sharon:

Dyer and Dean are SINGING and PLAYING, "Oh, Lindberg (What a

Sharon and the Assistant Director with a barely conscious 
Dennings being carried between them, heading for open front 
door.
CHRIS:
Nite, Burke. Take it easy.
DENNINGS:
(eyes still closed; a 
mutter)
Fuck it!
Chris shakes head. Then CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the piano 
group, which now includes the Astronaut. Dyer is just 
finishing the song. Group applauds. Dyer spots Chris.
DYER:
Hi, Chris. Great party.

CHRIS:
Thanks, Father. Keep goin'.
DYER:

I don't need the encouragement. My 
notion of heaven is a solid white 
nightclub with me center stage for 
all the rest of eternity.
(after amused reaction 
from group)
Does anyone else know the words to 
"I’ll Bet You’re Sorry Now, Tokyo 
Rose."
Chris starts singing as Dyer delightedly joins her. Then 
abruptly he stops, staring expressionlessly at something O.S. 
Chris, too, stops as Dyer nods head toward spot O.S.
DYER:
I believe we have a visitor, Mrs. 
MacNeil.
AT CHRIS AND ASTRONAUT
Chris looks where Dyer has indicated, and as sudden silence 
falls on the group, Chris gasps in shock and dismay, hand 
flying to her cheek, a small whimper coming up in her throat. 
The CAMERA MOVES TO TIGHT ON ASTRONAUT'S FACE as he, too, 
looks down and we HEAR:
REGAN:

You're going to die up there.
As Astronaut’s face turns gray with dismay and chilling 
apprehension, we HEAR:
CHRIS:

Oh, my God! Oh, —
AT REGAN - ASTRONAUT’S P.O.V.
Regan in nightgown, is staring up at Astronaut (CAMERA), and 
is urinating gushingly onto the rug.

toward stairs.
CHRIS:

Oh, come on, Rags, come with me,

Oh, I’m so sorry! She's been sick, 
she must be walking in her sleep! 
She didn’t know what she was

Moonlight streams in through open window. Regan turned toward 
wall, is in bed, dully staring at a point in space.
Chris sits on edge of bed. Through window, from street below, 
we HEAR O.S. SOUNDS and VOICES of departing guests.
CHRIS:
Howya feelin', honey? Better?
No response.
CHRIS:
Would you like me to read to you?
Regan shakes head slightly, still staring at wall.
CHRIS:
Okay, then. Try to sleep.
She leans over, kisses Regan, rises.
CHRIS:
’Night, my baby.
Chris leaves and is almost out the door when she is arrested 
by Regan calling to her in a low, despairing, haunted tone:
44.
REGAN:
Mother, what’s wrong with me?
CHRIS:
Why, honey, it’s nerves. That’s 
all. I mean, it’s just like the 
doctor said. You keep taking those 
pills and you’ll be fine. Just 
fine.
(a long wait for 
reaction; but Regan 
neither moves: nor 
speaks)
Okay, Rags?
Chris waits. Still nothing. Troubled and despondent.
Chris starts out of room.

The CAMERA is FIXED at one end of hall, and we see Chris exit 
at the other from Regan’s bedroom. Head down, thoughtful, she 
starts toward us; then remembers some­ thing and moves back to 
lean over balustrade railing and observe something below for 
a moment or two. We HEAR O.S. SCRAPING SOUND, like a brush 
against carpeting; Willie brushing cut the urine stains.
CHRIS:
(softly)
Comin’ out, Willie?
WILLIE:
Yes, madam. I think so.
CHRIS:
(slight nod)
Good.
She continues to stare for a moment more, then comes toward 
CAMERA again until she reaches door to her bedroom and 
enters. She closes door. A beat. Then from O.S., within 
Regan’s bedroom, we HEAR METALLIC SOUNDS, like bedsprings 
violently quivering. They are tentative at first, then 
insistent. Then:
REGAN:
(o.s.; calling with 
burgeoning apprehension 
and surmise)
Mother?
45.
Two beats. The bedspring SOUNDS. Then, much louder, and 
filled with terror:
REGAN:
(o.s.)
Mother, come here! Come here!
Chris' door has already shot open, and she’s burst out into 
the hall, racing for Regan's bedroom.
CHRIS:
Yes, I’m coming! All right, hon! 
I’m coming!
REGAN:
(o.s.)
Mothhheerrrrrrr!
CHRIS:
Oh, my baby, what’s --

Chris bursts in, continuing as she reaches for light switch 
and we HEAR MASSIVE METALLIC SOUNDS now:

The lights are on, and as Chris stares at Regan's bed O.S., 
she breaks off, electrified.
CHRIS:
Jesus! Oh, Jesus!
P.O.V. AT REGAN
She lies taut on her back, face stained with tears and 
contorted with terror and confusion as she grips at sides of 
narrow beet. It is savagely quivering back and forth!
REGAN:
Mother, why is it shaking? Make it 
stop! Oh, I'm scared! Make it stop! 
Oh, I'm scared, Mother, please make 
it stoooooooooo —
And on her elongated, fearful cry, we break it off before the

Dim desk lamp lighting. Dyer sits back of Karras' desk, 
wearing a "Snoopy" T-shirt. Karras is sitting on edge of oot, 
his eyes fixed low in haunted stare. They are red and raw 
from weeping. In his hand is a cup containing a small amount 
of scotch, and his eyes and voice are fogged by heavy 
drinking and chronic sleeplessness. Dyer is pouring from a 
bottle of Chivas Regal Into Karras' cup.
KARRAS:
Where'd you got the money for 
Chevas Regal, Joe? The poorbox?
DYER:
Don't be an asshole, that would be 
breaking my vow of poverty.
KARRAS:
Where did you get it then?
DYER:
I stole it.
KARRAS:
I believe you.
DYER:
College presidents shouldn't drink. 
It tends to set a bad example. I 
figure I relieved him of a terrible 
temptation.
Karras is nodding slightly, smiling, when suddenly he bursts 
into sobs.
KARRAS:
Ah, Joe.
DYER:
(with comforting 
gestures)
I know. I know.
Karras cries it through, the sobbing gradually subsiding.
47.
KARRAS:
(a whisper)
Ah, God.
Karras at last exhales an enormous sigh, closing his eyes, 
outstretched on cot.
DYER:
Do you think you can sleep new, 
Damien?
Karras nods head along with a throat sound of affirmation.
Dyer moves to foot of bed, undoes laces and removes Karras's 
shoes.
KARRAS:
Gonna steal my shoes now?
DYER:
No, I tell fortunes by reading the 
creases, Mow shut up and go to 
sleep,
KARRAS:
You’re a Jesuit cat burglar,
DYER:
Listen? someone’s got to worry 
about the bills around this place,
(moving softly to desk)
All you other guys do is just 
rattle your beads and pray for the 
hippies down on "M” Street.
Dyer flicks off desk light.
KARRAS:
Stealing is a sin.
A beat. Then, tenderly, Dyer touches a hand to Karras’ 
shoulder in goodnight, but as he starts to move toward door, 
Karras' hand reaches out and grips Dyer's wrist, squeezing, 
and giving a little shake in a gesture of gratitude and deep 
friendship. At this moment, the CAMERA is TIGHT on the HANDS, 
but then goes to Dyer, as he nods in acknowledgement. Then 
Dyer stares down and CAMERA FOLLOWS his gaze to TIGHT at the 
HANDS again, as healing sleep at last comes to Karras and his 
grip slackens and his hand slowly falls.
DYER:
(o.s.; whisper)
Goodnight, Damien.

Only two or three worshippers in the church. Karras, in his

at small table to side of altar:
KARRAS:

Thy house and the place where Thy 
glory dwelleth. Take not away my 
soul, O God, with the wicked, nor 
my life with men of blood...

Now Karras’ eyes are moistening with tears as:
KARRAS:

servant, Mary Karras ... who has 
gone before us with the sign of 
faith, and sleeps the sleep of 
peace. To her, O Lord, and to — all

Well, it's sometimes a symptom of a 
type of disturbance in the chemico-
electrical activity of the brain. 
In the case of your daughter, in 
the temporal lobes.
(a hand to side of his 
skull)
Up here, in the lateral part of the 
brain. Now it's rare, but it does 
cause bizarre hallucinations and 
usually happens just before a 
convulsion. It --
CHRIS:
(frowning over the "it")
Convulsion.
KLEIN:
(faintly evasive)
Well, the shaking of the bed. That 
was doubtless due to muscular 
spasms.
CHRIS:
To muscular spasms? Hey, I was on 
the bed and it even shook with me 
on it.
KLEIN:
Look, Mrs. MacNeil — your 
daughter's problem isn't beds; the 
problem is her; it's in her brain.
CHRIS:
Yeah, okay. So what causes this ... 
?
(she can’t find the term)
50.
KLEIN:
Lesion of the temporal lobe. It’s a 
kind of ... well, seizure disorder.
CHRIS:
Yeah. Look, I’ll tell you the 
truth, doc; I don’t understand how 
her whole personality could change.
KLEIN:
In temporal lobe, that’s very 
common, and can last in some cases 
for several days. It isn’t rare to 
find destructive, even criminal 
behavior.
Chris closes her eyes and lowers her forehead onto a fist.
CHRIS:
(murmuring)
Listen, tell me something good.
KLEIN:
Nell, now, don’t be alarmed. If 
it’s a lesion, in a way, she’s 
fortunate. Then all we have to do 
is remove the scar.

Chris immediately comes to door, opening it. She is extremely 
distraught and bewildered.

Karl stands beside door, staring numbly at O.S. SOUNDS, and 
as the doctors enter, we HEAR O.S. SOUND OF some­ thing 
SLAMMING ONTO BEDSPRIHGS REPEATEDLY (in addition to Regan’s 
cries).
REGAN:
(o.s.; hysterical)
Mooooootheeeeerrrrr!
P.O.V. - AT REGAN
52.
Flailing her arms, her body seems to be flinging itself up 
horizontally about a foot into the air above her bed, and 
then is slammed down savagely onto mattress, as if by an 
unseen person, and causing wrenching of Regan’s breath. It 
happens repeatedly and rapidly as:
REGAN:
Oh, Mother make him stop! Please 
stop him! Stop him! He’s trying to 
kill me! He's — ! Oh, please stoo 
pppppppppp hiwmmmmmmmmm, 
Motherrrrrrrrrrrr!
AT CHRIS AND DOCTORS
CHRIS:
Doc, what is it? What’s happening?
He shakes head, gaze fixed on Regan.
P.O.V. - AT REGAN
The up and down movements briefly; then they abruptly cease, 
and Regan twists feverishly from side to side, her eyes 
rolling upwards, into their sockets so that only the whites 
are exposed, while her legs keep crossing and uncrossing 
rapidly.
REGAN:
(moaning)
Oh, he’s burning me! I’m burning! 
I’m — ! Uhh!
With this sudden SOUND of pain, Regan has abruptly jerked her 
head back, disclosing a bulging, swollen throat, and she 
begins to mutter incomprehensively in a strangely deepened, 
guttural tone.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as the doctors approach. Reaching the bedside, Klein reaches 
down to take Regan's pulse.
KLEIN:
(soothingly)
All right, now, let’s see what the 
trouble is, dear. I’m just going to 
—
And abruptly Klein is reeling, stunned and staggering, across 
the room from the force of a vicious backward swing of 
Regan's arm as she suddenly sits up, her face contorted with 
hideous rage. Now, in a coarse and powerful, deep male voice:
53.
REGAN:
The sow is mine! Mine! Keep away 
from her!
AT KLEIN
He stares O.S., stunned, as Karl and Tanney kneel to his 
assistance.
KLEIN:
I'm all right.
They look toward Regan as we HEAR from O.S. a yelping laugh 
gushing up in her throat.
AT REGAN
Her head is tilted back. The laugh continues, demonic.
Then she falls to her back as if someone has pushed her down. 
She pulls back her nightgown with:
REGAN:
Fuck me, fuck —
AT REGAN
Sitting up, she begins to caress her own arms sensually as 
she croons in that guttural, coarse, male voice:
REGAN:
Ah, my flower ... my pearl ...
Abruptly she falls onto back again as if from a shove, and 
cries out with a wrench of breath. Then abruptly she is 
sitting up again, as if pulled by the hands, and:
REGAN:
(normal voice)
Oh, mother! Mother — !
Another sudden cry, and then she is bending at the waist, 
whirling her torso around in rapid, strenuous circles.
REGAN:
(weeping)
Oh, stop him, please stop him! It 
hurts! Make him s top! Make him. 
stop! I can't breaaaaaath!
AT CHRIS
CHRIS
Oh, my God, oh, my — !
54.
AT REGAN
Before she finishes her cry, she again appears to be shoved 
savagely onto her back, and as Tanney comes beside bed and 
observes, her eyes roll upward into their sockets and again 
she begins muttering incomprehensively in that thickened 
voice. Tanney leans head closer to try to make it out, 
frowning.
AT KLEIN
He is by the large window overlooking steps, preparing a 
hypodermic injection.
KLEIN
Sam!
He beckons Tanney over to him with move of head and continues 
preparing hypo. We HEAR the O.S., fevered gibberish from 
Regan. Tanney comes INTO FRAME.
KLEIN:
I’m giving her Librium. You’re 
going to have to hold her.
They look quickly toward:
REGAN:
(o.s.; terrified)
Oh, no!
REGAN:
No! Captain Howdy, don’t — !
Regan slamming up and down off the bed again.
REGAN:
Mother! Mother! Motherrrrrrrrr!

over Regan’s prolonged scream of pain and terror, Chris, with 
fists to her temples, turns to shriek at doctors:

Klein is ready. And over:

Blessed silence. Chris and Sharon have heads lowered, waiting 
by balustrade. Klein and Tanney exit Regan's room and 
approach then. Chris dabs at nose with moist balled-up 
handkerchief, her eyes red from crying.
KLEIN:
She’s heavily sedated. She'll 
undoubtedly sleep right through 
until tomorrow.
CHRIS:
Doc, how could she jump off the bed 
like that?
DR. TANNEY:
There's a perfectly rational 
explanation. Technically speaking, 
pathological states can induce 
abnormal strength and accelerated 
motor performance. More commonly, a 
ninety-pound woman sees her child 
pinned under the wheel of a truck, 
runs out and lifts the wheels half 
a foot up off the ground. You've 
heard the story. Same thing here.
CHRIS:
Yeah, okay.
DR. TANNEY:
Same principle, I mean.
CHRIS:
So what’s wrong with her? What do 
you think?
KLEIN:
Well, we still think it's temporal 
lobe, and —
CHRIS:
56.
(erupting)
What the hell are you talking 
about? She's been acting like some 
kind of a psycho, like a split 
personality! What do you — Guess 
I'm all uptight. I'm sorry. You 
were saying?
DR. TANNEY:
There haven’t been more than a 
hundred authenticated cases of so-
called dual or split personality, 
firs. MacNeil. Now I know the 
temptation is to leap to 
psychiatry, but any reasonable 
psychiatrist would exhaust the 
somatic possibilities first.
CHRIS:
Okay, so what’s next?
DR. TANNEY:
A pneumoencephalogram, I would 
think, to pin down that lesion ... 
outline the cavities of her brain. 
It will involve another spinal.
CHRIS:
(dismayed)
Oh, Christ.
DR. TANNEY:
It’s vital. What we missed in the 
EEG and the arteriograms could 
conceivably turn up there. At the 
least, it would exhaust certain 
other possibilities.

Klein stares down, shaking head and frowning in perplexity. 
Then he looks up at Chris:
KLEIN:
Do you keep any drugs in your 
house?
CHRIS:
Huh?
KLEIN:
Amphetamines? LSD?
CHRIS:
Gee, no. Look, I’d tell you. Mo, 
there’s nothing like that.
He nods and stares at his shoes; then looks up again.
KLEIN:
Are you planning to be home soon?

CHRIS:
No. No, I’m building a new house 
and the old one’s been sold. We 
were going to Europe for a while 
after Rags finished up with her

the stairs behind Sharon. It is Regan on all fours. She is 
gliding, spiderlike, noiselessly and swiftly, down the 
staircase, her tongue flicking rapidly in and out of her 
mouth like a snake. She halts directly beside Sharon.

Sharon stops, as does Regan. Sharon turns and sees nothing;

Shutters are closed and room is dark. Klein stands by bureau, 
watching. Chris sits on edge of bed, as does a PSYCHIATRIST. 
He is swinging a bauble on a chain back and forth, 
hypnotically, in front of Regan. He shines a penlight on the 
bauble so that it glows in the dark. He halts, inclining the 
penlight beam up, and we SEE Regan’s eyes are closed and 
appears to be in trance.
He turns off penlight.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Are you comfortable, Regan?
REGAN:
(voice-soft and whispery)
Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST:
How old are you?
REGAN:

let him answer?
REGAN:
No!
PSYCHIATRIST:
Why not?
REGAN:
I'm afraid!

PSYCHIATRIST:
If he talks to ma, I think he will 
leave you. Do you want him to leave 
you?
REGAN:
Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Let him speak, then. Will you let 
him speak?
REGAN:
(a pause; then:)
Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST
(firmly; new tone)
I am speaking to the person inside 
of Regan, now. If you are there you 
too are hypnotized and must answer 
all my questions. Come forward and 
answer me now: Are you there?
No response, and after three beats, we HEAR Regan’s BREATH 
coning loud and raspily, like a rotted, putrid bellows. The 
Psychiatrist sniffs, as if at a horrid smell, and then flicks 
on laser lamp and shines it up into Regan’s face. Chris 
gasps. We do not see Regan’s face, but play off reactions of 
Chris and the Psychiatrist. Chris lowers her head into a 
hand, the sight too unbearable for her, and she grips the 
Psychiatrist’s arm with the other in a tight vise.
This causes him to extinguish the laser lamp.
PSYCHIATRIST
Are you the person inside of Regan?
REGAN:
(in that coarse and 
guttural voice)
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Did you answer?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
If that’s yes, nod your head.
Regan nods.
64.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Who are you?
REGAN:
Nowonmai.
PSYCHIATRIST:
That’s your name?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST
Are you speaking in a foreign 
language?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Are you someone whom Regan has 
known?
REGAN:
One.
PSYCHIATRIST:
That she knows of?
REGAN:
One.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Part of Regan?
REGAN:
One.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Do you like her?
REGAN:
One.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Do you hate her?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Are you punishing her?
REGAN:
65.
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
You wish to harm her?
REGAN
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
To kill her?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST
But if Regan died, wouldn't you 
die, too?
REGAN:
One.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Is there something she can do to 
make you leave her?
REGAN:
Say.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Do you blame her for her parents' 
divorce?
His question elides into a prolonged gasp of startled pain 
and horrified incredulity as we go quickly to FULL AT REGAN, 
mad, evil glee in the eyes as now the light drops from the 
Psychiatrist's hand.
CLOSE AT PSYCHIATRIST
In the darkness, we SEE his mouth agape in horrible pain,, 
his eyes wide-staring. What has happened is that Regan has 
gripped his scrotum in a hand that is squeezing like an iron 
talon.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Marc! Marc, help me!
QUICKLY AT CHRIS
leaping up and away from Psychiatrist struggling to wrench 
Regan's hand away, a hand with incredible strength,
CHRIS:
Jesus!
66.
Klein races forward toward bed; Chris is running, panicked, 
for the lightswitch: Psychiatrist, in agony, struggling; 
Regan "Creature" with head tilted back, is cackling 
demoniacally and then howls like a wolf as Chris slaps at the 
lightswitch. The lights come on and we see:
AT BED
Regan, cackling demoniacally is rolling around on bed in 
savage struggle with Klein and Psychiatrist, who are still 
attempting to dislodge her hand from its grip. Grimaces, 
Gasps. Curses. The bedstead is quivering violently side to 
side.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Regan jerks upright. Her eyes roll upward into their sockets 
and she wrenches up a keening shriek of terror torn raw and 
bloody from the base of her spine as her face becomes her 
own. Then she falls backwards in a faint.
VIEW OF BED
Stillness. Regan unconscious. Two beats. One of the doctors 
makes a small move at extricating himself from the tangle. 
Chris crumples in a dead faint.
EXT. OUTDOOR TRACK IN HOLLOW OF GEORGETOWN U. CAMPUS - DAY

In shorts and T-shirt, Karras is doing laps. A portly middle-
aged man (KINDERMAN) is seated on bench at edge of track 
watching him. SOUNDS of baseball practice o.s. KARRAS passes 
Kinderman and shortly thereafter stops running, hands to hips 
as he walks, head down and panting. Kinderman rises and moves 
toward him.
KINDERMAN
(calling)
Father Karras?
Karras turns head, squinting into sun, his breath coming in 
great gulps, chest heaving. He waits for Kinderman to reach 
him, then beckons him to follow as Karras resumes his walk.
KARRAS
Do you mind? I'll cramp.
KINDERMAN
Yes, of course.
KARRAS
Have we met?
67.
KINDERMAN
No, we haven't, but they said I 
could tell; that you looked like a 
boxer. I'm William F. Kinderman, 
Father.
(flashing I.D.)
Homicide.
GATE OF RUNNING TRACK
Karras and Kinderman walk toward the path.
KARRAS:
What's this about?
KINDERMAN:
It’s true, you do look like a 
boxer. Excuse me, that scar, you 
know, there by your eye? Like 
Brando, it looks like, in 
Haterfront. Just exactly Marlon 
Brando. People tell you that, 
Father?
KARRAS:
Do people ever tell you that you 
look like Paul Newman?
KINDERMAN:
Always.
PATH ABOVE FOOTBALL FIELD
Karras and Kinderman continue walking.
KINDERMAN:
Look, Father, could we keep this 
between us? Confidential? Like a 
matter of confession, so to speak?
KARRAS:
Yes, of course.
KINDERMAN:
You know that director who was 
doing the film here, Father? Burke 
Dennings?
KARRAS:
Well, I’ve seen him.
KINDERMAN:
68.
You’ve seen him. You're also 
familiar with how last week he 
died?
KARRAS:
(shrugging)
Well, the papers ...
KINDERMAN:
That’s part of it.
KARRAS:
Oh?
KINDERMAN:
Only part. Listen, what do you know 
on the subject of witchcraft, 
Father? From the witching end, 
please, not the hunting.
TENNIS COURT PATH
Karras and Kinderman continue walking
KARRAS
(smiling)
Oh, I once did a paper on it.
KINDERMAN:
Really?
KARRAS:
From the psychiatric end.
KINDERMAN:
From whatever. Look, these 
desecrations going on in the church 
— they remind you of anything to do 
with witchcraft?
KARRAS:
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black 
Mass.
KINDERMAN:
And now Dennings — you read how he 
died?
KARRAS:
In a fall.
KINDERMAN:
Well, I'll tell you; and please! 
Confidential!
69.
Karras nods. They stop, and continue talking.
KINDERMAN:
Burke Dennings, good Father, was 
found at the bottom of those steps 
down to "M" Street with his head 
turned completely around and facing 
backwards.
KARRAS:
(after a beat)
It didn't happen in the fall?
KINDERMAN
Sure, it's possible. Possible. 
However ...
KARRAS:
Unlikely.
KINDERMAN:
Exactly.
They start walking again.
KINDERMAN:
So on the one hand a witchcraft 
kind of murder, on the other, Black 
Mass type desecrations in the 
church.
KARRAS:
The killer and the desecrator, you 
think, then, are the same?
KINDERMAN:
Maybe somebody crazy, Father 
Karras; maybe someone with a spite 
against the Church, some 
unconscious rebellion perhaps! And 
who also has access to the Church 
in the middle of the night.
KARRAS:
A sick priest. Is that it?
PATH SOUTH OF DAHLGREN CHAPEL. TRACKING BEHIND KARRAS AND 
KINDERMAN
As they walk.
KINDERMAN:
70.
Listen, Father, this is hard for 
you — please! — I understand. But 
for priests on the campus here, 
you're the psychiatrist; you'd know 
who was sick at the time, who was 
not, I mean, this kind of sickness. 
You’d know that.
KARRAS
I really know of no one who fits 
the description.
They stop and sit on the railing.
KINDERMAN:
Ah, yes; doctor's ethics. If you 
knew, you wouldn't tell.
KARRAS:
No, I probably wouldn't.
KINDERMAN:
Incidentally — I mention it only in 
passing — but this ethic is 
recently considered illegal. Not to 
bother you with trivia, but lately 
a psychiatrist in sunny California, 
no less, was put in jail for not 
telling the police what he knew 
about a patient.
KARRAS:
(slight, warm smile)
That a threat?
KINDERMAN:
Don’t talk paranoid; I mention it 
in passing.
KARRAS:
I could always tell the judge it 
was a matter of confession.
KINDERMAN:
(glancing at him, faintly 
gloomy)
Want to go into business, Father?
(he looks away dismally)
'Father' — what 'Father'? You're a 
Jew, I could tell when I met you.
Karras chuckles.
KINDERMAN:
71.
Yes, laugh; go ahead; laugh.
But then Kinderman smiles, looking impishly pleased with 
himself, and turns to Karras with beaming eyes.
KINDERMAN:
That reminds me. The entrance exam 
for policemen, Father? When I took 
it, one question went something 
like: ”What are rabies and what 
would you do for then?" Know what 
some dumbhead put down for an 
answer? Emis? "Rabies," he said, 
"are Jew priests and I would do 
anything that I could for them.”
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. QUADRANGLE, NEAR FOUNTAIN AND GAZEBO
Karras and Kinderman walking.
KINDERMAN:
Listen, Father. Listen, doctor - 
... Am I crazy, or could there 
maybe be a witch coven here in the 
District? Right now, I mean. Today.
KARRAS:
Oh, come on.
KINDERMAN:
So then what am I looking for. 
Father?
KARRAS:
A madman. Maybe someone on drugs.
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, QUADRANGLE-WASHINGTON STEPS TRACKING 
SHOT - KARRAS AND KINDERNAN WALKING
KINDERMAN:
You like movies, Father Karras?
KARRAS:
Very much.
KINDERMAN:
I get passes for the very best 
shows, Mrs. K., she gets tired, 
though; never likes to go.
KARRAS:
That's too bad.
KINDERMAN:
72.
It's too bad; yes, I hate to go 
alone. You know, I love to talk 
film; to discuss; to critique. 
Would you like to see a film with 
me? I've got passes for the Crest. 
It's Othello.
KARRAS:
Who's starring?
KINDERMAN:
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and 
Othello, Groucho Marx. You're 
happy?
Karras smiles. They have halted at entry to Jesuit residence 
hall.
KINDERMAN:
Listen, Father, one more time ~- 
you can think of some priest who 
fits the bill?
KARRAS:
Oh, come on, now.
KINDERMAN:
Just answer the question, please, 
Father Paranoia.
KARRAS:
(leaning closer; looking 
grave)
Look, Lieutenant, can I tell you 
who I really think did it?
KINDERMAN:
No, who?
KARRAS:
Dominicans.
KINDERMAN:
I could have you deported, you know 
that?
KARRAS:
What for?
KINDERMAN:
A psychiatrist shouldn't piss 
people off.
(as Karras chuckles)
73.
Plus also the goyim, plainly 
speaking, would love it. Who needs 
it? A priest who wears sneakers and 
T-shirts!
Karras turns and walks away toward entry to residence hall. 
Calling out after him:
KINDERMAN:
I lied! You look like Sal Mineo!

(1) Regan in another fit, in bed and restrained by straps. 
Clinic Director is in the room with other doctors observing. 
They are baffled.
(2) Hospital corridor. Nurse walking to door to Regan’s room. 
Pauses outside as hears curious rapping sound from within. 
She enters room. Dim nightlight illumination. The rappings 
have ceased. Regan is sleeping. Nurse checks her pulse, then 
frowns in wonderment as she spots something on Regan’s chest.
She parts Regan’s pajama top to sea better, and as she leans 
closer, she looks mystified. We now see that on Regan’s 
chest, faintly, the letter "L", followed by a separation, 
then the letter "M", having risen up in blood-red, light bas-
relief lettering on her skin.
INT. CLINIC DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
162
162
The room is glass enclosed on two sides, so that we have a 
view in b.g. or a traffic of DOCTORS AND NURSES.
Clinic Director and two of the Doctors from earlier clinic 
scenes are present. Chris sits in chair, taut and drawn. In 
the room, A CLOSED CIRCUIT TV MONITOR SHOWING REGAN IN THE 
HOSPITAL ROOM, IN A FIT, as:
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
People with very, very sensitive 
skin can just trace with a finger, 
and then a little while later it 
shows up. Not abnormal. Why an "L" 
and an "M", of course, we don’t 
understand. In the meantime ....
ANOTHER ANGLE - (TIME LAPSE)
74.
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
It looks like a type of disorder 
that you rarely ever see any mere, 
except among primitive cultures. We 
call it somnambuliform posses­sion. 
Quite frankly, we don’t know much 
about it except that it starts with 
some conflict or guilt that 
eventually leads to the patinet’s 
delusion that his body's been 
invaded by an alien intelligence; a 
spirit, if you will. In times gone 
by, the entity possessing the 
victim is supposed to be a so-
called demon, or devil.
FULL AT TV MONITOR - (TIME LAPSE)
CHRIS:
Look, I’m telling you again and 
you’d better believe it, I’m not 
about to put her in a goddamn 
asylum!
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
It’s —
CHRIS:
I don’t care what you call it! I’m 
not going to put her away!
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
Well, I’m sorry.
CHRIS:
Yeah, sorry, Christ, eighty-eight 
doctors and all you can tell me 
with all of your bullshit....
ANOTHER ANGLE - (TIME LAPSE)
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
There is one outside chance of a 
cure, I think of it as shock 
treatment. As I say, it’s a very 
outside chance. But then since 
you're so opposed to your daughter 
being hospitalized —
CHRIS:
Will you name it, for God’s sake? 
What is it?
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
75.
Have you any religious beliefs?
CHRIS:
No, I don’t.
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
And your daughter?
CHRIS:
Why?
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
Have you ever heard of exorcism, 
Mrs. MacNeil?
CHRIS:
Come again.
CLINIC DIRECTOR:
It’s a stylized ritual in which 
rabbis and priests try to drive out 
a so-called invading spirit. It’s 
pretty much discarded these days, 
except by the Catholics who keep it 
in the closet as a sort of 
embarrassment. It has worked, in 
fact, although not for the reason 
they think, of course. It was 
purely the force of suggestion. The 
victim's belief in possession 
helped cause it; and in just the 
same way this belief in the power 
of exorcism can make it disappear.
CHRIS:
Jesus! Are you telling me to take 
her to a witch doctor?

A limo has pulled up and Karl is exiting driver's seat and 
opening rear door while Sharon exits on right rear side. Karl 
reaches in and picks up a small figure (Regan) wrapped in a 
blanket from Chris in back seat.
While Karl carries Regan toward door of MacNeil house where 
Willie is standing, anxiously watching, Chris exits car in 
deep depression.

Regan is faced to side. Sharon is adjusting Sustagen flask 
used for a naso-gastric feeding. Karl is affixing a set of 
restraining straps to bed. Chris enters, standing by door and 
observing. Karl lets straps hang loose, nods to Sharon. 
Sharon starts out of room, pausing for a moment by door to 
look at Chris.
Chris moves slowly forward to bedside and looks down at 
Regan, WE SER now that Regan’s face is torn and bloated with 
numerous scratch marks and scabs. Pro­jecting hideously from 
her nostrils is the naso-gastric tubing. Karl has finished 
adjusting straps. He, too, now looks down at Regan. Two 
beats. He looks up at Chris.
KARL:
She is going to be well?
CHRIS:
(after a beat)
I don’t know.
ANOTHER ANGLE
A beat. Then Chris leans and tenderly adjusts Regan’s pillow. 
In the process, she discovers a crucifix under it made of 
white bone. She lifts it out, examining it, frowning. Then, 
at Karl:

pillow?

SHARON:

SHARON:

Fine, Sharon. Fine, I believe you,

KINDERMAN:
(at Chris)
Might your daughter remember if 
perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her 
room that night?
CHRIS:
(vague apprehensiveness)
Why do you ask?
KINDERMAN:
Might your daughter remember?
CHRIS:
Oh, no she was heavily sedated.
KINDERMAN:
It’s serious?
CHRIS:
Yes, I’m afraid it is.
KINDERMAN:
May I ask ... ?
CHRIS:
We still don’t know.
KINDERMAN:
Watch out for drafts. A draft in 
the fall when a house is hot, is a 
magic carpet for bacteria.
CHRIS:
Why are you asking all this?
KINDERMAN:
79.
Strange ... strange ... so 
baffling. The deceased comes to 
visit, stays only twenty minutes 
without even seeing you, and leaves 
all alone here a very sick girl. 
And speak­ing plainly, Mrs. MacNeil, 
as you say, it’s not likely he 
would fall from a window. Besides 
that, a fall wouldn't do to his 
neck what we found except maybe a 
chance in a thousand. My hunch? My 
opinion? I believe he was killed by 
a power­ful man: point one. And the 
fracturing of his skull — point two 
plus the various things I have 
mentioned, would make it very 
probable — probable, not certain — 
the deceased was killed and then 
afterwards pushed from your 
daughter's window. But no one was 
here except your daughter. So how 
could this be? It could be one way: 
if someone came calling between the 
time Miss Spencer left and the tine 
you returned.
CHRIS:
(hoarsely; stunned)
Judas priest, just a second.
KINDERMAN:
The servants? They have visitors?
CHRIS:
Never. Not at all.
KINDERMAN:
You expected a package that day? 
Some delivery?
CHRIS:
Not that I know of.
KINDERMAN:
Dry cleaning, maybe? Groceries? 
Liquor? A package?
CHRIS:
I really wouldn’t know. Karl 
handles all of that.
KINDERMAN:
Oh, I see.
80.
CHRIS:
Want to ask him?
KINDERMAN:
Never mind, it's remote. You've got 
a daughter very sick, and — well, 
never mind.
Chris rises.
CHRIS:
Would you like another cup of 
coffee?
Kinderman acknowledges in the affirmative. They move to 
Kitchen.

Kinderman follows Chris toward Sharon’s working area.
He notices Regan's artwork.
KINDERMAN:
Cute ... It’s so cute. Your 
daughter? She’s the artist?
Chris nods. Then:
KINDERMAN:
Incidentally, just a chance in a 
Trillion, I know; but your daughter 
— you could possibly ask her if she 
saw Mr. Dennings in her room that 
night?
CHRIS:
Look, he wouldn’t have a reason to 
be up there in the first place.
KINDERMAN:
I know that; I realize; that’s 
true; very true. But if certain 
British doctors never asked "What’s 
this fungus?", we wouldn’t today 
have penicillin. Correct?
CHRIS:
When she’s well enough. I’ll ask.
KINDERMAN:
Couldn’t hurt. In the meantime ...
81.
(they have come to the 
front door and Kinderman 
falters, embarrassed)
Look, I really hate to ask you; 
however ...
CHRIS:
(tensing)
What?
KINDERMAN:
For my daughter ... you could maybe 
give an autograph?
He has reddened, and Chris almost laughs with relief.
CHRIS:
Oh, of course. Where’s a pencil?
KINDERMAN:
Right here!
He has whipped out the stub of a chewed-up pencil from the 
pocket of his coat while he dipped his other hand in a pocket 
of his jacket and slipped out a calling card.
KINDERMAN:
She would love it.
CHRIS:
What’s her name?
Chris presses the card against the door and poises pencil 
stub to write. There follows a weighty hesita­tion.
KINDERMAN:
(eyes desperate and 
defiant)
I lied. It's for me.
(fixes gate on card and 
blushes)
Write 'To William F. Kinderman' — 
it's spelled on the back.
Chris eyes him with a wan and unexpected affection, checks 
the spelling of his name and writes on card as:
KINDERMAN:
You know that film you made called 
“Angel?” I saw that film six times.
CHRIS:
If you were looking for the 
murderer, arrest the director.
82.
KINDERMAN:
You're a very nice lady.
CHRIS:
You're a very nice man.
Kinderman exits. Chris leans against the door, thoughtful, 
for a moment. Then she moves on. Walking by door to basement 
we HEAR washing machine O.S.. Chris halts, then opens door 
and calls down:
CHRIS:
Willie.
No response. She starts down the stairs.
INT. BASEMENT PLAYROOM - DAY

Chris comes down the stairs. Willie is working in the service 
area.
CHRIS:

WILLIE:
Oh, yes, Madam.
CHRIS:
Look, never mind dinner tonight. 
I’m not hungry, and if anyone —
Her eye has fallen to a book that is lying open, face down, 
on top of the dryer. IN AN INSERT WE SEE THE TITLE: "A 
HISTORY OF WITCHCRAFT." Picking it up?
CHRIS:
You reading this?
WILLIE:
I try, but very difficult. Madam.
CHRIS:
Some illustrations.
WILLIE:
I find in Kiss Regan bedroom.
Chris looks up at her. Dryer stops spinning and Willie turns 
away to take out the clothes. Chris resumes thumbing through 
the book. Abruptly she FREEZES, turning ashen. She holds gaze 
on book for a beat; then, numbly:
CHRIS:
83.
Willie — you found this in Regan’s 
bedroom?
WILLIE
Yes, Madam. Under bed.
Still numb, Chris runs a finger along edge of right­ hand 
page, and in an INSERT, we see that a narrow strip — in the 
manner of Burke Dennings — has been surgically shaved from 
along its length.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Willie and Chris look up at SOUND from above, in Regan’s 
bedroom, of a blow, of someone staggering across the room, of 
someone crashing to wail and fall­ing heavily to ground. This 
is followed, as Chris races upstairs, by an at first 
indistinct altercation between a tearful and terror-stricken 
Regan, and someone else — a man — with a powerful and 
incredibly deep bass voice. Regan is pleading; the man 
commanding in obscene terms.
ANGLE AT CHRIST FROM TOP OF STEPS (SECOND FLOOR)
Rushing up, frenzied, while Willie and Sharon stare up from 
bottom of steps. We HEAR:
REGAN:
(o.s.)
No! Oh, no, don't! Don’t — !
DEEP BASS VOICE:
(o.s.)
Do it, damned piglet! You'll — I
REGAN:
(o.s.)
No! Oh, no don't! Please, don’t —
And in this manner, the VOICES continue — and never 
overlapping — while CAMERA TRACKS with Chris to door to 
Regan's bedroom.

Chris bursts in, then stands rooted in shock, as we HEAR 
SOUND OF BED SHAKING VIOLENTLY, and the continua­tion of 
dialogue between Regan and the thundering deep MALE VOICE.
REGAN:

Please! Oh, please don’t m(-ake) —

84.
MALE VOICE:
(o.s.)
You’ll do as I tell you, filth! 
You’ll — !
Chris has turned head to stare at:
P.O.V. AT KARL
Blood trickling down from forehead, he lies uncon­scious on 
floor near bureau. The CAMERA GOES TO BED disclosing Regan 
sitting up in a SIDE VIEW TO CAMERA, her legs propped wide 
apart and the bone-white crucifix clutched in rawknuckled 
hands that are upraised over her head. She seems to be 
exerting a powerful effort to keep the crucifix UP, away from 
her vagina, which we cannot (AND WILL NOT) see, her nightgown 
pulled up to precisely that point. We see that her FACE 
ALTERS EXPRESSION to match each voice in the argument, BOTH 
OF WHICH ARE COMING FROM HER! When the deep male voice speaks 
through her mouth, the features instantaneously contort into 
a demonic grimace of malevolence and rage. Blood trickles 
down from Regan’s nose. The nasogastric tubing has been 
ripped out. During the above:
REGAN:
Oh, no don’t make me! Don’t!
REGAN-DEMONIC:
You’ll do it!
REGAN:
No! NO, — !
REGAN-DEMONIC:
Do it, stinking bitch! You’ll do 
it! You’ll do it or I’m going to 
kill you!
REGAN:
Nooooo!
REGAN-DEMONIC:
Yes, do it, do it, do- !
QUICK CUT TO:
CLOSE DOWN ANGLE - AT REGAN
showing nothing from the waist down as with eyes wide and 
staring she seems to be flinching from the rush of some 
hideous finality, her mouth agape and shrieking in terror as 
she stares up at the upheld crucifix.
85.
Then the shriek ends as the demonic face once again takes 
over her features, and the piercing cry of terror elides into 
a yelping, gutteral laugh of male­volent spite and rage 
triumphant as the crucifix is plunged down and out of sight 
at Regan’s vagina.
The demonic face looks down, and we HEAR Regan-Demon roaring 
in that coarse deafening voice as the crucifix is repeatedly 
brought up and plunged down again, blood now spotting it as:
DEMON:
Yes, now you’re mine, you stink­ing 
cow! You're mine, you're mine, 
you're — !
Chris has raced in, screaming, grappling to take hold of the 
crucifix. We see blood on Regan's thighs, but NEVER THE 
VAGINA. The Demon first turns on Chris with a look of 
mindbending fury. Then:
DEMON:
Ahhh, little pig mother!
The Demon pulls Chris* head down, rubbing her face sensually 
against pelvic area, then lifts head and smashes Chris a blow 
across the chest that sends her reeling across room and 
crashing to a wall with stunning force while Demon laughs 
with bellowing spite. Chris crumples against wall near Karl.
Willie arrives, staring in confusion and horror.
Chris begins to pick herself up. She stares toward bed, her 
head bloodied, and begins to crawl pain­ fully toward it.
DEMON:
Ah, there’s my pearl, my sweet 
honey piglet!
MOVING SHOT - AT BED - CHRIS' P.O.V.
as she crawls closer. Regan now has back to CAMERA, looking 
down, and we know the crucifix is being used for 
masterbation.
DEMON:
Ahh! Yes, mine, you are mine, you 
are — !
It breaks off and the Regan-Demon thing abruptly looks over 
shoulder at CAMERA (and Chris), which halts at the sight. The 
features of Regan’s face seem to be those of Burke Dennings. 
Then it sneaks in the British-accented giggly VOICE of the 
dead director.

REGAN-DENNINGS:
Do you know what she did, your 
cunting daughter?

Chris. She wears oversized dark glasses and is leaning over 
bridge railing.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Chris sees a large, powerfully built wan wearing khakis, 
sweater and sturdy, scuffed white tennis shoes approaching 
her. She quickly looks away. Though she doesn’t recognize 
him, we see it is Karras. Coming up beside her:
KARRAS:
Are you Chris MacNeil?
CHRIS:
Keep movin', creep.
KARRAS:
I'm Father Karras.
She reddens, jerks swiftly around.
CHRIS:
Oh, my God! Oh, I’m — ! Jesus!
She is tugging at her sunglasses, flustered, and immediately 
pushing them back as the sad, dark eyes probe hers.
KARRAS:
I suppose I should have told you 
that I wouldn't be in uniform.
CHRIS:
Yeah, it would've been terrific. 
Got a cigarette, Father?
KARRAS:
(reaching into pocket of 
shirt)
Sure.
She lights up. After a deep exhalation of smokes
CHRIS:
87.
How'd a shrink ever get to be a 
priest?
KARRAS:
It’s the other way around. The 
Society sent me through medical 
school and psychiatric training.
CHRIS:
Where?
KARRAS:
Oh, well, Harvard; John Hopkins, 
Bellevue, then —
CHRIS:
(over him)
You’re a friend of Father Dyer’s, 
that right?
KARRAS:
Yes, I am.
CHRIS:
Pretty close?
KARRAS:
Pretty close.
CHRIS:
Did he talk about the party?
KARRAS:
Yes.
CHRIS:
About my daughter?
KARRAS:
No, I didn’t know you had one.
CHRIS:
Yeah, she’s twelve. He didn’t 
mention her?
KARRAS:
No.
CHRIS:
He didn’t tell you what she did?
KARRAS:
He never mentioned her.
88.
CHRIS:
Priests keep a pretty tight mouth, 
then; that right?
KARRAS:
That depends.
CHRIS:
On what?
KARRAS:
On the priest.
CHRIS:
I mean, what if a person, let’s 
say, was a criminal, like maybe a 
murderer or something, you know? If 
he came to you for help, would you 
have to turn him in?
KARRAS:
If he came to me for spiritual 
help, I’d say, no.
CHRIS:
You wouldn’t.
KARRAS:
No, I wouldn’t. But I’d try to 
persuade him to turn himself in.
CHRIS:
And how do you go about getting an 
exorcism?
KARRAS:
Beg pardon?
CHRIS:
If a person’s possessed by some 
kind of a demon, how do you go 
about getting an exorcism?
KARRAS:
Well, first you'd have to put him 
in a time machine and get him back 
to the sixteenth century.
CHRIS:
(puzzled)
Didn’t get you.
KARRAS:
89.
Well, it just doesn’t happen 
anymore, Miss MacNeil.
CHRIS:
Since when?
KARRAS:
Since we learned about mental 
illness; about paranoia; dual 
personality; all of those things 
that they taught meat Harvard.
CHRIS:
You kidding?
KARRAS:
Many educated Catholics, Miss 
MacNeil, don’t believe in the devil 
anymore; and as far as possession 
is concerned, since the day I 
joined the Jesuits I’ve never met a 
priest who’s ever in his life 
performed an exorcism. Not one.
CHRIS:
Oh, really?
(a shaking hand to her 
sunglasses)
Well, it happens, Father Karras, 
that someone very close to me is 
probably possessed. She needs an 
exorcism. Will you do it?
She has slipped off the glasses and Karras feels momentary, 
wincing shock at the redness, at the desperate pleading in 
the haggard eyes.
CHRIS:
Father Karras, it’s my daughter!
KARRAS:
(gently)
Then all the more reason to forget 
about exorcism and —
CHRIS:
(outburst in a cracking 
voice)
Why? God, I don’t understand!
He takes her wrist in a comforting hand.
KARRAS:
90.
To begin with it could make things 
worse.
CHRIS:
But how?
KARRAS:
The ritual of exorcism is 
dangerously suggestive. And 
secondly, Miss MacNeil, before the 
church approves an exorcism, it 
conducts an investigation to see if 
it's warranted. That takes time. In 
the meantime, your —
CHRIS:
Couldn't you do the exorcism 
yourself?
KARRAS:
look, every priest has the power to 
exorcise, but he has to have church 
approval, and frankly, it’s rarely 
ever given, so -
CHRIS:
Can't you even look at her?
KARRAS:
Well, as a psychiatrist, yes, I 
could, but -
CHRIS:
She needs a priest! I've taken her 
to every goddamn fucking doctor 
psychiatrist in the world and they 
sent me to you! Now you send me to 
them!
KARRAS:
But your -
CHRIS:
(shrieking)
Jesus Christ, won't somebody help 
met
She crumples against Karras' chest, moaning, with convulsive 
sobs.
CHRIS:
Help her! Help her! Oh, somebody 
...
91.
The final "help" elides into deep, throaty sobbing.

Chris and Karras are ascending staircase, Karras frowning in 
consternation at O.S. SOUND, from Regan's bedroom, of the 
demonic Voice threatening and raging.
When they reach door to Regan's bedroom, we pick up Karl 
leaning against opposite wall, arms folded, head bowed.
KARL:
It wants no straps, still.
Karras stares at him; looks at door; exchanges looks with 
Chris. Then he grasps doorknob and starts to open door. He 
reacts, as to a noxious odor; then steels self.
INT. REGAN’S BEDROOM - DAY
196

Reining back his revulsion, Karras enters slowly, scanning 
room; then freezes in horror. Arms held down by double set of 
restraining straps, it seems no longer Regan but the demonic 
entity that now lies on the bed, turning head to stare at 
Karras. The eyes bulge wide in wasted sockets, shining with 
mad cunning and burning intelligence, seething in a face 
shaped into a hideous mask of evil. The hair is tangled and 
thickly matted, and Regan’s legs and arms are spider-thin, a 
distended stomach jutting up grotesquely. Karras reacts, then 
closes door and strives for an affable, conversational tone.
KARRAS:
Hello, Regan.
(fetching a chair to 
bedside)
I’m a friend of your mother's. I'd 
like to help you.
Regan tugs up wrists revealing double set of restraining 
straps. Her voice is a deep, male bass, thick with menace and 
power.
REGAN-DEMON
You might-loosen these straps, 
then.
KARRAS:
Are they uncomfortable for you?
REGAN-DEMON
Extremely.
92.
KARRAS:
I’m afraid you might hurt yourself. 
Regan.
REGAN-DEMON:
I am not Regan.
KARRAS:
Oh, I see. Well, then, maybe we 
should introduce ourselves. I'm 
Damien Karras. Who are you?
REGAN-DEMON:
I'm the devil. New kindly undo 
these straps.
KARRAS:
If you're the devil, why not just 
make the straps disappear?
REGAN-DEMON
That's much too vulgar a display of 
power, Karras.
KARRAS:
Where's Regan?
REGAN-DEMON
She is in here with us, my friend; 
we are Legion.
KARRAS:
Show me Regan and —
CLOSE AT REGAN
The features are her own, now, and the eyes are filled with 
terror, her mouth gaping open in a soundless, electrifying 
shriek for help. But then quickly the Regan identity is 
replaced by a remolding of Regan's features into those of 
Denning's and we HEAR:
DENNINGS' VOICE
Won't you take off these straps, 
please? They're hurting me! Really!
And now Regan's face instantaneously is remolded back to the 
demonic.
REGAN-DEMON
(in the VOICE of the 
derelict in subway scene)
Couldjya help an old altar boy, 
Faddah? I'm Cat'lie.
93.
AT KARRAS — REACTING
as we HEAR the O.S. MOCKING LAUGHTER of the demon.
ANOTHER ANGLE
REGAN-DEMON
Incidentally, your mother is here 
with us, Karras. Do you wish to 
leave a message? I will see that 
she gets it.
And Karras is suddenly dodging a projectile stream of vomit/ 
leaping out of his chair so that only his hand and portion of 
his sweater are hit. The demonic entity laughs mockingly.
KARRAS:
If that is true, then you must know 
my mother’s maiden name? What is 
it?
Regan hisses at him, mad eyes gleaming/ and her head gently 
undulating like a cobra’s.
KARRAS:
What is it?
Regan, in an angry bellow that shivers through the walls of 
the room, begins to low like a steer. Her eyes then roll 
upwards into their sockets, exposing whites only. For a time, 
Karras watches, ashen, as the bellowing continues.
INT. CHRIS’ BATHROOM AND HALL OFF BEDROOM - LATE DAY
201

Karras' sweater is craped over shower pole as he washes hands 
at sink. Chris sits on edge of tub, anxiously fidgeting with 
towel in lap as she watches Karras, From down the hall, O.S., 
we HEAR varied ANIMAL SOUNDS.
KARRAS:
But your daughter doesn’t say she's 
a demon, Mrs. MacNeil; she says 
she's the devil himself and if 
you've seen as many psychotics as I 
have, you'd know that’s like saying 
you’re Napoleon Bonaparte.
CHRIS:
94.
Look, I’ll tell you something. 
Father; you show me Regan’s 
identical twin: Same face, same 
voice, same smell, same everything 
down to the way she dots her i’s, 
and still I'd know in a second that 
it wasn't really her! I’d know it! 
I’d know it in my gut and I'm 
telling you I know that thing in 
there is not my daughter!
(she leans back drained)
Now you tell me what to do. Go 
ahead: You tell me that you know 
for a fact there’s nothing wrong 
with my daughter except in her 
head; that you know for a fact that 
she doesn’t need an exorcism; that 
you know it wouldn't do her any 
good. Go ahead! You tell me! You 
tell me what to do!
For long troubled seconds, the priest is still. Then he 
answers softly:
KARRAS:
Well, there’s little in this world 
that I knew for a fact.
Chris stares at him a brief beat, then rises and moves 
quickly out of bathroom. Karras frowns, hearing REGAN howling 
like a wolf. Chris returns with a framed photo of Regan and 
shows it to him.
CHRIS:
That’s her. That's Regan. That was 
taken four months ago.
Karras is deeply affected.
KARRAS:
Look, I'm only against the chance 
of doing your daughter more harm 
than good.
CHRIS:
But you’re talking now strictly as 
a psychiatrist, right?
KARRAS:
95.
No, I’m talking now also as a 
priest. If I go to the Chancery 
office to get permission to perform 
an exorcism, the first thing I’d 
have to have is a pretty 
substantial indication that your 
daughter’s condition isn't a purely 
psychiatric problem. After that, 
I'd need evidence the Church would 
accept as signs of possession.
CHRIS:
Like what?
KARRAS:
(continuing)
Well, like her speaking in a 
language that she’s never known or 
studied.
CHRIS:
And what else?
KARRAS:
I don’t know. I’m going to have to 
look it up,
CHRIS:
I thought you were supposed to be 
an expert.
KARRAS:
You probably know more about 
demonic possession right now than 
most priests.

Chris opens door for Karras. He steps out onto stoop carrying 
the witchcraft book and a slender box containing a tape 
recording.
KARRAS:
Did your daughter know a priest was 
coming over?
CHRIS:
No, No, nobody knew but me.
KARRAS:
Did you know that my mother had 
died just recently?
96.
CHRIS:
Yes, I’m very sorry.
KARRAS:
Is Regan aware of it?
CHRIS:
Why?
KARRAS:
Is she aware of it?
CHRIS:
No, not at all.
He nods.
CHRIS:
Why’d you ask?
KARRAS:
(shrugging)
Not important. I just wondered.
He studies her for a moment without expression; then quickly 
moves away. Chris watches from the doorway.
Karras crosses the street. At the corner, he drops the book 
and stoops quickly to retrieve it, then rounds the corner and 
vanishes from sight. Chris closes the door.
And now the CAMERA DISCLOSES Kinderman observing house from 
an unmarked car parked a little down the street, toward

Kinderman frowns in puzzlement as he sees something: in the

does not see the shutter slowly pulled shut.

Oh, just tell him. how you are, 
Rags, and what you’ve been doin'.
Karras' look grows more and more haunted as he listens.

Karras lifts the Communion Host in consecration. It trembles 
in his fingers with a hope he dares not hope.
KARRAS:
"The day before he suffered he took 
bread in his sacred hands and 
looking up to heaven, to you, his 
almighty Father, he gave you thanks 
and praise. He broke the bread, 
gave it to his disciples, and said: 
Take this, all of you, and eat it: 
For this is my body."
Then:
When supper ended, again he gave 
you thanks and praise, gave the cup 
to his disciples and said: Take 
this all of you and drink from it. 
This is the cup of my blood, the 
blood of the new and everlasting 
covenant, the mystery of faith. It 
will be shed for you and for all 
men so that sins may be forgiven. 
Do this in memory of me.

Karras sits at foot of bed. He is in his clerical robes.
REGAN-DEMON:
Hello, Karras. What an excellent 
day for an exorcism. Do begin it 
soon.
99.
KARRAS:
(puzzled)
You would like that?
REGAN-DEMON:
Intensely.
KARRAS:
But wouldn’t that drive you out of 
Regan?
REGAN-DEMON:
It would bring us together.
KARRAS:
You and Regan?
REGAN-DEMON:
You and us.
Karras stares and then reacts as he feels something cold and 
unseen at his neck. Then he jerks his head around at a loud, 
sudden banging sound. O.S. a bureau drawer has popped open, 
sliding out its entire length.
The demon bursts into hysterical, gleeful laughter.
KARRAS:
You did that?
REGAN-DEMON
Assuredly.
KARRAS
Do it again.
REGAN-DEMON
In time, in time. But mirabile 
dictu, don't you agree?
KARRAS:
(startled)
You speak Latin?
REGAN-DEMON
Ego te absolvo.
The demon chuckles.
KARRAS:
(excitedly)
Quod nomen mihi est?
REGAN-DEMON:
100.
Bon jour.
KARRAS
(persistent)
Quod nomen mihi est?
REGAN-DEMON
Bon nuit. La plume de ma tante.
The demon laughs full and mockingly. Karras holds up a small 
vial of water that he has had cupped in his hand.
The demon abruptly breaks off the laughter.
REGAN-DEMON:
(warily)
What is that?
KARRAS:
Holy water.
Karras has uncapped the vial and now sprinkles its contents 
over Regan. Instantly, Regan (Demon) withes to avoid the 
spray, howling in pain and terror.
REGAN-DEMON:
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! It burns me! It 
burns! It burns! Ah, cease, priest, 
bastard! Cease! Ahhhhhhhh!
Karras looks disappointed. The howling ceases and Regan's 
head falls back onto pillow. Regan's eyes roll upward into 
their sockets, exposing the whites. Regan-Demon is now 
rolling head feverishly from side to side muttering an 
indistinct gibberish:
REGAN-DEMON:
I‘drehtellteeson. Dobetni tee siti. 
Leafy. Tseerpet reef. Emitsuvig.
Karras is intrigued and moves to side of bed. He turns up 
volume on recorder, then lowers his ear to Regan's mouth to 
pick it up. He listens. The gibberish ceases and is replaced 
by deep and raspy breathing. Karras straightens up.
KARRAS:
Who are you?
REGAN-DEMON
Nowonmai... Nowonmai ...
KARRAS:
Is that your name?
101.
The lips move. Fevered syllables, slow and unintelligible. 
Then it ceases.
KARRAS:
Are you able to understand me?
Silence. Only the eerie sound of breathing. Karras waits a 
little; then he shakes head, disappointed. He grips Regan’s 
wrist to check her pulse; then he draws back Regan’s 
nightgown top and looks with pained expression at the sight 
of her skeletal ribs. He shakes his head.

water; when I sprinkled it on her, 
she reacted very violently.
CHRIS:
And so?
KARRAS:
It’s just ordinary tap water.
CHRIS:

except for a night light glow. Sharon has flash­ light on now, 
trained low. They stop by bed. Regan seems to be in coma, the 
whites of her eyes glowing eerily in the dim light. Heavy 
breathing. Karras takes her wrist to check her pulse. The 
naso-gastric tube is in place, Sustagen seeping into Regan's 
motionless body.
Beads of perspiration on Regan's forehead. Sharon is bending, 
gently pulling Regan's pajama tops wide apart, exposing her 
chest. Karras wipes a little perspiration off Regan’s 
forehead, then stares at it on his fingers, rubbing them 
together with deeper consternation. Then he looks up at 
Sharon, feeling her gaze upon him.
SHARON:

I don’t know if it’s stopped. But 
watch. Just keep looking at her 
chest.
Karras follows her instruction. One beat. Two. Then, flipping

INT. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

231
PRESIDENT:
Well, ha docs know the background. 
I doubt there's any danger in just 
having him assist. There should be 
a psychiatrist present, anyway.
CARDINAL:
And what about the exorcist? Any 
ideas? I'm blank.
PRESIDENT:
Well, now, Lankester Merrin*s 
around.
CARDINAL:
Merrin? I had a notion he was over 
in Iraq. I think I read he was 
working on a dig around Nineveh.
PRESIDENT:
107.
That’s right. But he finished and 
came back around three or four 
months ago, Mike. He's at 
Woodstock.
CARDINAL:
What’s he doing there? Teaching?
PRESIDENT:
No, he’s working on another book.
CARDINAL:
Don't you think he’s too old, 
though, Tom? How's his health?
PRESIDENT:
Well, it must be all right or he 
wouldn't be running around digging 
up tombs, don’t you think?
CARDINAL:
Yes, I guess so.
PRESIDENT:
And besides, he's had experience, 
Hike.
CARDINAL:
I didn't know that.
PRESIDENT:
Maybe ten or twelve years ago, I 
think, in Africa. Supposedly the 
exorcism lasted for months. I heard 
it damn near killed him.
EXT. PROSPECT STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - NIGHT
233
233
A cab pulls up to house in LONG SHOT. Out from the cab steps 
a tall, old priest (MERRIN) , carrying a battered valise. A 
hat obscures his face. As the cab pulls away Merrin stands 
rooted, staring up at second floor of MacNeil house like a 
melancholy traveler frozen in time.
INT. REGAN'S BEDROOM
234
234
Regan is apparently unconscious, her features recomposed into 
her own in the normal state, (as happens whenever she's 
unconscious). Sharon is winding sphygmanoneter wrappings 
around Regan's arm while Karras pinches Regan's Achilles 
tendon, checking her sensitivity to pain. During this;
108.
SHARON:
Four hundred milligrams in less 
than two hours! That’s enough to 
put an army out!
Karras nods; silently takes Regan’s blood pressure.
KARRAS:
90 over 60.
INT. ENTRY TO MACNEIL HOUSE - NIGHT
235
235
Chris opens doer, disclosing Merrin, face still shaded by 
hat, and Roman collar by coat buttoned at top.
CHRIS:
Yes?
MERRIN:
(reaching for hat)
Mrs. MacNeil? I'm Father Merrin.
And now we SEE it is the OLD MAN in Khaki from opening 
sequence.
CHRIS:
(flustered)
Oh, my gosh, please come in! Oh 
come in!
Suddenly, Chris flinches at a SOUND from above: the voice of 
the Demon, booming, yet muffled, like amplified premature 
burial.
REGAN-DEMON:
(o.s.)
Merriiiinnnnnnnnn!
CHRIS:
God almighty!
REGAN-DEMON:
(o.s.)
Merriiinnnnnnn!
Karl steps incredulous from the study and Karras comes out 
from the kitchen. Merrin turns and puts hand out to Karras.
MERRIN:
(warmly; serene)
Father Karras.
KARRAS:
109.
Hello, Father. Such an honor to 
meet you.
Merrin takes Karras’ hand in both of his, searching Karras’ 
face with a look of gravity and concern while upstairs the 
demonic laughter segues into vicious obscenities directed at 
Merrin.
MERRIN:
Are you tired?
KARRAS:
No, Father.
MERRIN:
I should like you to go quickly 
across to the residence and gather 
up a cassock for myself, two 
surplices, a purple stole, some 
holy water, and your copy of "The 
Roman Ritual." The large one. I 
believe we should begin.
KARRAS:
Don’t you want to hear the 
background of the case, first?
MERRIN:
Why?
EXT. RESIDENCE HALL AREA - NIGHT

Karras, in his cassock, is crossing swiftly toward house 
carrying a cardboard laundry box.

Karras enters.
INT. STUDY OF MACNEIL HOUSE - NIGHT
238
238
Karras and Merrin are dressing in vestments taken out of 
laundry box.
MERRIN:
110.
Especially important is the warning 
to avoid conversations with the 
demon. We may ask what is relevant, 
but anything beyond that is 
dangerous. Extremely. Especially, 
do not listen to anything he says. 
The demon is a liar. He will lie to 
confuse us; but he will also mix 
lies with the truth to attack us. 
The attack is psychological, 
Damien. And powerful. Do not 
listen. Remember that. Do not 
listen.
(as Karras hands him 
surplice)
Is there anything at all you would 
like to ask now?
KARRAS:
No. But I think that it might be 
helpful if I gave you some 
background on the different 
personalities that Regan has 
manifested. So far, I'd say there 
seem to be three.
MERRIN:
(haunted expression)
There is only one.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - AT STAIRS - NIGHT
239
239
Merrin and Karras, fully vested, Roman Rituals in their 
hands, slowly come to stairs and ascend in single file, 
Karras back of Merrin.
ANGLE DOWN HALL FROM OUTSIDE ROOM
as the priests approach. Chris and Sharon, bundled in 
sweaters, watch them. The priests halt by them; look at them 
a moment, then:
MERRIN:
What is your daughter's middle 
name?
CHRIS:
Teresa.
MERRIN:
What a lovely name.
He nods; then looks to door. The others follow suit.
111.
MERRIN:
(continuing; nods to 
Karras)
All right.
Karras opens door, disclosing Karl sitting in corner wearing 
a heavy hunting jacket, a look of bewilderment and fear on 
his face as he looks toward us. Merrin hangs motionless for a 
moment.
INT. REGAN’S BEDROOM
241
241
Merrin, just outside the door, staring in at:
REGAN-DEMON
lifting head from pillow, staring at Merrin with burning 
eyes.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Merrin steps into the room, followed by Karras, Chris and 
Sharon. Karras sees door is open, closes it.
Merrin goes to side of bed while Karras moves to its foot. 
They halt. (NOTE: "The room is freezing. Breath is condensing 
throughout.) A beat. Regan licks a wolfish, blackened tongue 
across dried lips with a SOUND like parchment being smoothed 
over. Then:
REGAN-DEMON:
Proud scum! This time you are going 
to lose!
Regan tilts back head and laughs gleefully. Merrin traces the 
sign of the cross above her, then repeats the gesture at 
Karras and Karl, and as he plucks the cap from holy water 
vial in his hand, the demonic laughter breaks off. Merrin 
begins sprinkling the holy water on Regan, and she jerks head 
up, mouth and neck muscles trembling as she bellows 
inchoately with hatred and fury. Then:
MERRIN:
Be silent!
The words have flung forth like bolts. Karras has flinched 
and jerked his head around in wonder at Merrin, who stares 
commandingly at Regan. The demon is silent, returning his 
stare with eyes now hesitant, blinking and wary. Merrin caps 
the holy water vial routinely and returns it to Karras, who 
slips it in his pocket and watches as Merrin kneels down 
beside the bed and closes his eyes in murmured prayer:
112.
MERRIN:
'Our Father, who art in...'
Regan spits and hits Merrin in the face with a yellowish glob 
of mucus that oozes slowly down the exorcist's cheek. His 
head still bowed, Merrin plucks a handker­chief out of his 
pocket and serenely, unhurriedly wipes away the spittle as:
MERRIN:
' ... heaven, hallowed by Thy name. 
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, 
on earth, as it is in heaven. Give 
us this day, our daily bread, and 
forgive us our trespasses, as we 
forgive those who trespass against 
us. And lead us not into 
temptation.'
KARRAS:
'And deliver us from the evil one.'
Karras briefly looks up. Regan’s eyes are rolling upwards 
into their sockets until only the whites are exposed. Karras 
looks uneasy, then returns to his text to follow as Merrin 
now stands, praying reverently:
MERRIN:
‘God and Father of bur Lord Jesus 
Christ, I appeal to your holy name, 
humbly begging your kindness, that 
you may graciously grant me help 
against this unclean spirit now" 
tormenting this creature of yours; 
through Christ our Lord,'
KARRAS:
'Amen.'
As Merrin continues reading, Karras again glances un as he 
hears Regan hissing, sitting erect with the whites of her 
eyes exposed while her tongue flicks in and out Karras 
doesn’t hear it, a beat.
MERRIN:
Damien.
Karras turns to Merrin. We SEE him eyeing Karras serenely as 
he motions with his head at copy of the RITUAL in Karras’ 
hands.
MERRIN:
The response, please, Damien.
Karras, still dumbfounded, glances again to the bed.
113.
Then he collects himself and looks down at his text.
KARRAS:
(excited)
"And the son of iniquity be 
powerless to harm her.'
MERRIN:
’Lord, hear my prayer.'
KARRAS:
‘And let my cry come unto Thee.'
Here Merrin reaches up his hand in a workaday manner and 
traces the sign of the cross unhurriedly three times on 
Regan's brow while:
MERRIN:
(continuing to read 
ALOUD)
'... Almighty Rather, everlasting 
God, who sent your only begotten 
Son into the world to crush that 
roaring lion ...'
The hissing ceases and from the taut-stretched "O" of Regan’s 
mouth comes the nerve-shredding lowing of a steer, growing 
shatteringly louder and louder as:
MERRIN:
(continuing)
'... snatch from ruination and from 
the clutches of the noonday devil 
this human being made in your 
image.'
Merrin reaches his hand up again (still reading aloud) and 
presses a portion of his purple stele to Regan's neck.
Abruptly, the bellowing ceases and in the ringing silence a 
thick and putrid greenish vomit begins to pump from Regan's 
mouth in slow and regular, sickening spurts that 002e like 
lava ever her lip and flow in waves onto Merrin's hand, which 
he does not move as we now HEAR:
MERRIN:
(continuing)
114.
'God and Lord of all creation, by 
whose might Satan was made to fall 
from heaven like lightning, strike 
terror into the beast now laying 
waste your vineyard. Let your 
Mighty hand cast out this cruel 
demon from this creature. Drive out 
this persecutor of the innocent 
...'
The bed begins to rock lazily, and then to pitch, and then 
suddenly is violently dipping and yawing. During this, the 
vomit still pumping from Regan’s mouth, Merrin routinely 
makes adjustments, keeping the stole firmly to Regan’s neck.
During the latter part of the prayer, the bed has ceased its 
movements and floated with a cushioned thud to the rug, and 
Karras now stares mesmerized at Merrin's hand buried under 
the thick and mounded vomit.
MERRIN:
Damien?
Karras turns to him blankly.
MERRIN:
'Lord, hear my prayer.'
KARRAS:
(turning to bed)
'And let my cry come unto Thee.'
Now Merrin takes a step back and jolts the room with the lash 
of his voice as he commands:
MERRIN:
'I cast you cut, unclean spirit, 
along with every satanic power of 
the enemy! Every spectre from hell! 
Every savage companion! It is 
Christ who commands you, He who 
flung you headlong from the heights 
of Heaven! You robber of life! You 
corrupter of justice! You investor 
of every obscenity!
115.
Regan has ceased vomiting. Karras moves slowly around to 
bedside and reaches down, checking Regan's pulse. She is 
silent and unmoving. Into icy air, thin mists of vapor waft 
upward from the vomit like a reeking offering. And now Karras 
lifts his eyes, staring, as with nightmare slowness, a 
fraction at a time. Regan's head turns toward him, swiveling 
like a mannequin's and creaking with the sound of a rusted 
mechanism until the dread and glaring whites of the eyes are 
fixed directly on Karras. And now Karras glances up warily as 
the lights in the room begin flickering, dimming, then fade 
to an eerie, pulsing amber. Regan turns back toward Merrin, 
and now a muffled POUNDING jolts the room; then another; and 
another, and then steadily, the splintering sound of 
throbbing at a ponderous rate like the beating of a heart 
that is massive and diseased.
MERRIN
(o.s.)
'Why do you stand and resist, 
knowing as you must that Christ the 
Lord brings your plans to nothing. 
He has already stripped you of your 
powers and laid waste your kingdom. 
He has cast you forth into the 
outer darkness. To what purpose do 
you brazenly refuse? For you are 
guilty before almighty God, whose 
laws you have transgressed. You are 
guilty before his Son, our Lord 
Jesus Christ, whom you dared to 
nail to the cross. You are guilty 
before the whole human race.'
MERRIN:
(oblivious)
‘Depart, you monster! Your place is 
in solitude! Your abode is in a 
nest of vipers! Get down and crawl 
with then! It is God Himself who 
commands you ...'
Merrin continues and now the poundings begin to come steadily 
louder, faster, until Sharon cries out, pressing fists 
against her ears as the poundings grow deafening and now 
suddenly accelerate to a terrifying tempo. And then abruptly 
the poundings cease and Merrin's prayer comes through in the 
silence.
MERRIN:
'Oh, God of Heaven and earth, God 
of the angels and arch­ angels...’
OVER the continued recitation, we HEAR the return of the 
demon as the flickering haze grows gradually brighter.
116.
REGAN-DEMON:
(raging at Merrin)
Hypocrites!
MERRIN
(o.s.)
'God who has power to bestow life 
after death and rest after toil.'
REGAN-DEMON
Liar! Proud bastard! Go back to the 
mountain top and speak to your only 
equal!
MERRIN:
(o.s)
'I humbly entreat you to deliver 
this servant of yours, Regan 
Theresa MacNeil, from the unclean 
spirit.'
AT MERRIN
MERRIN:
'I adjure you, ancient serpent, by 
the judge of the living and the 
dead, by your ...'
ANGLE AT REGAN
As Merrin continues, O.S. (remainder of material in 
appendix), Regan begins to emit various animal noises, and 
Karras, a hypodermic syringe in one hand, moves to bedside, 
nodding for Chris and Sharon to approach. As he does, the 
Dennings personality takes over in Regan, turning to plead 
with Karras:
REGAN-DENNINGS:
What the hell are you doing, 
Karras? Can’t you see the littbe 
bitch should be in a hospital? She 
belongs in a madhouse! It’s —
The entity breaks off, jerking head toward Chris, as Chris 
and Sharon cone to bedside.
REGAN-DEMON:
Ah, the mother of piglet! Yas, come 
see your handiwork, sow!
While Sharon and Chris pin Regan’s arms, Karras administers 
the injection.
REGAN-DEMON:
117.
(continuing; at Chris)
See the puke! See the murderous 
bitch! Are you pleased! It is you 
who has done it! Yes, you with your 
career before her, before husband, 
before — !
And now the Demon has jerked its head around to Karras, eyes 
bulging with fury.
REGAN-DEMON:
And you, bastard! You!
Chris has swabbed Regan’s arm and as Karras flicks the needle 
into wasted flesh:
KARRAS:
(at Chris)
Now get out!
As Chris flees the room we are:
AT DEMON
REGAN-DEMON:
Yes, we know of your kindness to 
mothers!
AT KARRAS
His head is lowered as he extracts the needle, and we HEAR 
O.S. mocking LAUGHTER of the Demon. Karras blanches and for a 
moment does not move.
ANOTHER ANGLE
MERRIN:
(continuing adjuration)
"The mystery of the Cross commands 
you! The faith of the saints and 
the martyrs commands you! The blood 
of Christ commands you! The prayers 
of — "
Merrin breaks off and looks up at hearing the demon cry in 
sudden pain, as well as anger. He repeats the line that 
produced this effect:
MERRIN:
"The blood of Christ commands you!"
Same reaction; greater.
MERRIN:
118.
"The blood of Christ commands you."
Midway through the word "command", however, a prolonged howl 
of pain and rage from:
REGAN-DEMON:
Daaaammmm youuuuu, Merrrriiinnnn!
But the cry of "Merrin" gives way to a prolonged exhalation 
of breath, almost as in death. And now from Regan comes the 
slow, lilting singing — in a sweet clear voice like a 
choirboy’s — of a hymn sung at Catholic benediction: “Tantum 
Ergo."
AT REGAN DEMON
The whites of the eyes are exposed. The singing.
A FULL ANGLE - REGAN, KARRAS
as Merrin appears with a towel. He wipes the vomit from 
Regan’s face with tender, weary movements. Sharon enters room 
and comes to bed. She takes the towel from Merrin’s hands.
SHARON:
I’ll finish that, Father.
Karras checks Regan’s pulse.
KARRAS:
(at Sharon)
Clean her up, please, and give her 
half of a 25 milligram Compazine 
suppository.

In the dimness, Merrin and Karras lean against wall, their 
faces numb with shock as they stare at door to Regan's room. 
O.S. SINGING continues.
KARRAS:
Father, what’s going on in there? 
What is it? If that’s the Devil, 
why this girl? It makes no sense.
MERRIN:
I think the point is to make us 
despair, Damian — to see ourselves 
as animal and ugly — to reject our 
own humanity — to reject the 
possibility that God could ever 
love us.
119.
It has an impact. Karras thinks. Then:
MERRIN:
Excuse me.
Merrin
hurries down hall cut of sight of Karras, then takes out a 
pill box, extracts a nitro-glycerin tablet and places it 
under his tongue. Karras turns to door as Sharon emerges with 
bundle of fouled bedding and clothing.
Karras takes a deep breath and enters.
INT. REGAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
256
256
Regan sleeps but Karras' frosty breath tells us the air in 
the room is still icy. He shivers. Then he walks to the 
bedside, reaches down and grips Regan’s wrist to take her 
pulse. As he stares at sweepsecond hand of wristwatch, we are 
CLOSE AT KARRAS and we HEAR THE VOICE OF KARRAS' MOTHER.
REGAN-MOTHER:
(o.s.)
You leave me to be priest, Dimmy. 
Send me institution. Why? Why you 
do dis?
Karras is almost trembling with the effort to keep from 
looking at Regan's face. And now the VOICE grows frightened 
and tearfully imploring.
REGAN-MOTHER:
You always good boy, Dimmy. Please! 
I am ’fraid! Please don't chase me 
outside, Dimmy! Please!
KARRAS:
(vehement whisper)
You*re not my mother!
REGAN-MOTHER:
Dimmy, please!
KARRAS:
You’re not my — !
INTERCUT - REGAN - KARRAS
as the Demonic entity now returns, raging:
REGAN-DEMON:
120.
Won't you face the truth! You 
believe what Merrin tells you? You 
believe him to be holy? Well, he is 
not! And I will prove it! I will 
prove it by killing the piglet!
(grinning)
Feel her pulse, Karras! Feel it!
Karras looks down at the wrist still gripped in his hand.
REGAN-DEMON
Somewhat rapid, Karras? Yes. But 
what else? As, yes, feeble.
As Karras leans quickly to his medical bag and extracts 
stethoscope:
REGAN-DEMON:
(a laugh; then as Karras 
puts instrument to chest)
Listen, Karras! Listen! Listen, 
well!
Karras looks very worried. Demon laughs. Then, as Merrin 
enters:
REGAN-DEMON:
I will not let her sleep!
The Demon puts its head back in prolonged, hideous laughter, 
Karras staring numbly. Merrin comes to bedside and looks at 
Regan, then at Karras' stunned expression.
MERRIN:
What is it?
KARRAS:
Her heart’s begun to work 
inefficiently, Father. If she 
doesn’t get rest soon, she’ll die 
from cardiac exhaustion.
MERRIN:
(alarmed)
Can’t you give her drugs?
KARRAS:
No, she might go into coma. If her 
blood pressure drops any more ...

Merrin is fighting sleep. Regan is grunting like a pig, 
whites of eyes exposed. Karras is checking Regan’s heartbeat, 
and then her pulse, and then wraps black sphygmomanometer 
cloth around Regan’s arm to take a blood pressure reading. 
Both priests have blankets draped over their shoulders. Their 
breath is condensing in the frosty air of the room.
REGAN-MOTHER
I not good to you, Dimmy? Why you 
leave me to die all alone?
Merrin is at his side, clutching at his arm and trying to 
draw him away, Karras resisting, his gaze fixed trancelike on 
the O.S. face.
MERRIN:
Damien!
REGAN-MOTHER:
Why, Dimmy?
MERRIN:
Go and rest for awhile!
AT REGAN
The features and eyes are subtly reminiscent of Karras1 
mother, but vividly evident is the large, circular mole that 
the mother had on her right cheek.
REGAN-MOTHER
Dimmy, please!
MERRIN:
Go and rest!
Reluctantly, Karras leaves. Merrin, after a beat, turns to 
Regan, the demonic entity reappears.
REGAN-DEMON:
(seething whisper)
You will lose!

Chris is sitting at breakfast nook looking at an album of 
photographs. She's on the verge of tears. Karras enters 
kitchen, pauses as he sees Chris.
CHRIS:

122.
There's coffee there, Father.
Chris moves quickly past Karras with her face averted.
CHRIS:
Excuse me.
She exits kitchen. Karras' gaze shifts to album. We see that 
these are candid photos of Regan. In one photograph, she is 
blowing out candles on a birthday cake. In another, she is 
sitting on a lake-front dock in shorts and T-shirt with "Camp 
Brown Ledge” stencilled on the front. Karras is deeply 
affected, close to a breakdown, he puts a trembling hand to 
brow, with a fervently whispered, desperate:
KARRAS:
God... God help...
CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he leaves kitchen. Passing the living 
room, he HEARS sobbing from within. Looking in, he sees Chris 
on sofa convulsively weeping. Sharon, beside her, is 
comforting her.

He halts, eyeing her bruise. She knows what he’s staring at. 
She puts a hand to the bruise. He stares for a beat. Then:
KINDERMAN:
Look, I’m sorry to disturb you at 
this hour of the night, but I’m 
afraid that I’m going to have to 
talk to your daughter, Mrs. NacNeil 
and I’d like to take a look at her 
room, if you don’t mind.
CHRIS:
Regan's bedroom?
KINDERMAN:
Yes, immediately, please. I have a 
warrant.
CHRIS:

Oh, please, not now! She's gotten 
worse, Lieutenant. Please! Please,

Karras enters Regan's bedroom and walks wearily to the chair 
where he had been sitting beside Merrin. During the above 
moves:
REGAN-DEMON:
(o.s.)
... would have lost! Would have 
lost and you knew it, Merrin! 
Bastard!
REGAN ON BED - MERRIN
Limp and disjointed, Merrin lies sprawled face-down on floor 
on far side of bed and beside it. Regan-Demon cranes head 
over side of bed at him, croaking inchoately with rage and 
frustration.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Karras rushes to Merrin, kneeling beside him, and turning 
him over, disclosing bluish coloration of Merrin's face.
REGAN-DEMON:
(o.s.)
Die, will you? Die? Karras, heal 
him! Heal him! Bring him back that 
we may finishhhhhh itttttt!
And now inchoate croakings and moans of rage and frustration 
from o.s., as Karras feels for Merrin's pulse and in a 
wrenching, stabbing instnat of anguish realizes that Merrin 
is dead. Groaning in whisper:
KARRAS:
Ah, God no!
Karras sags back on his heels, an aching moan of grief rising 
up in his throat as he shuts his eyes fiercely and shakes his 
head in despair. Then:
KARRAS:
No!
Karras' eyes fix on something on the floor around Merrin: the 
pill box and a scattering of nitroglycerin pills.
124.
Karras begins to gently and tenderly place Merrin's hands on 
his chest in the form of a cross. An enormous, mucoid glob of 
yellowish spittle hits the dead man's eye,
AT REGAN-DEMON
REGAN-DEMON:
(mocking)
The last rites!
Then it puts back its head and laughs long, and wildly 
through:
KARRAS:
You son-of-a-bitch! You murdering 
bastard!
A projectile stream. of VOMIT from O.S. strikes his face but 
he is oblivious.
KARRAS:
Yes, you‘re very good with 
children! Well, come on! Let's see 
you try something bigger!
Karras has his hands out like great fleshy hooks, beckoning, 
challenging.
KARRAS:
Come on! Try me! Take me! Come into 
me!
AT REGAN-DEMON
In the demonic features now, a trembling, wild-eyes rage; a 
fearsome struggle over some irresistibly tempting decision 
that the Demon is fighting against.
KARRAS
as he breaks off, his body jerking as if seized suddenly by 
some inner force alien to him. Yet his features do not change 
as his hands go to his throat and he struggles to his feet. 
His actions are those of a man who either has been possessed 
by or thinks he has been possessed by the Demon, but who also 
is f fighting for control of his own organism. And now here, 
suddenly, on a move toward the bed and Regan (who, if she is 
In SHOT, is unconscious, her face in shadow), Karras' 
features briefly contort into those of the demon Pazuzu; but 
then return to normal again on a backward jerk by Karras as;
KARRAS:
No!
125.
The Demon — in Karras' body — had moved to kill Regan; but 
Karras has won control now long enough to reach the window, 
rip the shutters off their hinges and leap out.

Chris rises and runs trembling toward the window.
AT CHRIS AND KIRDERMAN FROM EXTERIOR WINDOW
Looking down, Chris freezes at what she sees. Then from 
behind her, in a small, wan voice calling tearfully:
REGAN:
(o. s.)
Mother?
126.
(Chris half turns her-
head)
Mother, what’s happening?
AT CHRIS AND KINDERMAN FROM INTERIOR ROOM
as they turn toward Regan.
REGAN
(o.s.)
Oh, please! Please, come here!
AT REGAN
The real Regan, weeping in helpless confusion and fear.
REGAN:
Mother, please! I’m afraid!
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Chris rushes forward to Regan, arms outstretched, and 
weeping:
CHRIS:
Rags! Oh, my baby, my baby!
She is on the bed and embracing her daughter.

at an accident scene. Policeman shepherds them back.
DYER, followed by Sharon, is frantically pushing through as:
FIRST PASSERBY:
What happened?
SECOND PASSERBY:
Some guy fell down the steps.
POLICEMAN:
Come on, now, move it back, folks. 
Give him air. Let him breathe.
Dyer has pushed through almost to Policeman.
DYER:
Let me through, please! Coming 
through! Coming — !
P.O.V. - AT KARRAS
127.
He lies crumpled and twisted in a pool of blood. Dyer kneels 
to him.
AT DYER - KARRAS - LOW ANGLE
DYER:
Damien ... Can you talk?
Karras slowly and painfully reaches out his hand to Dyer’s 
wrist and grips it, briefly squeezing. Fighting back the 
tears, Dyer leans his mouth close to Karras' ear.
DYER:
Do you want to make your confession 
now, Damien?
Karras squeezes Dyer’s wrist.
DYER:
Are you sorry for all of the sins 
of your life and for having 
offended almighty God?
A squeeze. And now Dyer leans back and slowly traces the sign 
of the cross over Karras, reciting the words of absolution:
DYER:
Ego te absolve in nomine Patris, et 
Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
AT DYER
as he again leans over with his mouth close to Karras' ear.
DYER:
Are you — ?
He halts, slightly turning his head toward his wrist.
CLOSE AT DYER'S WRIST
gripped by Karras. The grip slackens, the hand slowly 
opening, then falling limp.
ANGLE AT DYER KARRAS
Slowly and tenderly, Dyer slips the eyelids down as we HEAR 
the WAILING SIREN of approaching ambulance. Dyer weeps ...
SLOWLY FADE OUT:
FADE IN

Chris is folding a final item into a suitcase open on her bed 
as Karl stands by. She closes lid.
CHRIS:
Okay, Karl, that's all of it.
Sharon enters, something clasped in one hand.
SHARON:
Chris, what about those stereo 
earphones?
CHRIS:
Storage.
Karl, who has closed up suitcase, exits.
SHARON:
Okay, we're all set then. Dulles 
Airport's pretty far, Chris. You'd 
best allow an hour.
CHRIS:
Gonna miss you.
SHARON:
Same here, Chris.
CHRIS:
You won't change your mind?
SHARON:
(slight shake of head)
People change.
(she unclasps hand, 
disclosing Karras* medal 
and chain which she holds 
up to Chris)
Here, I found this in her room. It 
belonged to Father Karras.
Chris, after a pause, takes it from her.
SHARON:
(again glancing at watch)
You'd better hurry.

Chris is coming toward Regan’s bedroom.
CHRIS:
(calling)
Hey, Rags, how ya comin’?
INT. REGAN’S BEDROOM
289
289
Looking a little van and gaunt, dark sacs beneath her eyes, 
Regan stands by her bed, holding two stuffed animals in her 
grip as she stares down with indecision and a child’s 
discontent at an over-packed, open suitcase.
CHRIS:
How ya comin’, hon? We’re late.
REGAN:
There’s just not enough room in 
this thing!
CHRIS:
Well, ya can’t take it all, now, 
sweetheart. Just leave it and 
Willie’ll bring it later on. Come 
on, babe, we've got to hurry or 
we’re going to miss the plane.
DOORCHIME SOUND
REGAN:
(mildly pouting)
Oh, okay.
CHRIS:
Atta’ girl.
Chris exits SCENE, heading for stairs. Regan sighs with 
resignation, looking down at the animals.
INT/EXT. FRONT DOOR AREA - MACNEIL HOUSE - DAY

Chris is opening door, disclosing Dyer in cassock and Roman 
collar saying goodbye to Sharon, latter going to limo at curb 
and getting in as Chris steps outside and:
CHRIS:
Oh, hi, Father.
DYER:
130.
Hi, Chris. Just came by to say ’so 
long,'
CHRIS:
I was just about to call. We're 
just leaving.
DYER:
Going to miss you.
CHRIS:
Me too.
DYER:
How's the girl?
CHRIS:
Oh, she's great, really great.
Karl passes between them with two suitcases heading for 
Chris' car which is parked in front of house. Dyer nods a 
little glumly.
DYER:
I'm glad.
CHRIS:
She still can't remember,
DYER:
Well, that's good.
CHRIS:
Funny. He never even knew her.
Dyer looks up, and then so does Chris, their gazes meeting.
DYER:
What do you think happened. Do you 
think she was really possessed?
CHRIS:
Oh, yeah, you bet I do. I mean, if 
you're asking if I believe in the 
Devil, the answer is yes — yeah, 
that I believe.
DYER:
But if all of the evil in the world 
makes you think that there might be 
a Devil — then how do you account 
for all of the good?
Chris' reaction reveals that this is a telling point.
131.
Then into SCENE comes Regan, dressed to go.
REGAN:
Okay, I finished.
CHRIS:
Honey, this is Father Dyer.
REGAN:
Hi, Father.
DYER:
Hi.
(tousles her hair)
All set to go.
Regan, has begun to stare oddly up.at Dyer’s Ronan collar, 
some tugging remembrance in her eyes. Willie passes them with 
Ragan’s luggage, which she takes to car to load in trunk.
KARL:
Ready, Mizzes?
CHRIS:
Okay, Karl.
(taking Dyer’s hand)
Bye, Father. I’ll call you from 
L.A.
DYER:
Goodbye, Chris.
Suddenly, impulsively, in a quick and unexpected move, Regan 
reaches up to Dyer, pulls his head down and kisses his cheek; 
a quick stack. Then, locking puzzled herself at what she has 
done:
REGAN:
Goodbye.
DYER:
Goodbye, dear.
Chris remembers the medal still in her hand. She offers it to 
him.
CHRIS:
Oh, I forgot. Here.
Dyer, who instantly recognizes the medal, stares at it a 
moment. Then:
DYER:
Why don't you keep it?
132.
A beat. Dyer sees that Chris* eyes are clouding with tears.
DYER:
It’s all right, Chris. For him, 
it's the beginning,
Chris holds his gaze, then nods.
CHRIS:
C’mon, Rags. Gotta hurry.
As Chris and Regan leave FRAME, CAMERA STAYS ON DYER, turning 
to watch them. Then:
CHRIS:
(o.s., calling)
Bye, Father!
P.O.V. - AT CAR PULLING AWAY
and moving quickly down Prospect Street.
AT DYER WATCHING
Willie goes back inside house. O.S. SOUND OF SQUEAL OF CAR 
BRAKES.
P.O.V. - AT SQUAD CAR
Kinderman is emerging, hurrying toward Dyer.
KINDERMAN:
I came to say goodbye.
DYER:
You just missed them,
Kinderman stops. A beat. Then:
KINDERMAN:
How's the girl?
DYER:
She seemed fine.
KINDERMAN:
Ah, that's good. Very good. Well, 
that's all that's important. Back 
to business. Back to work. Bye now, 
Father.
He turns and takes a step toward the squad car, then stops 
and turns back to stare speculatively at Dyer.
133.
KINDERMAN:
You go to films, Father Dyer?
DYER:
Sure.
KINDERMAN:
I get passes.
(hesitates for a moment)
In fact, I’ve got a pass for the. 
‘Crest' tomorrow night. You'd like 
to go?
DYER:
What’s playing?
KINDERMAN:
‘Wuthering Heights.’
DYER:
Who’s in it?
KINDERMAN:
Heathcliffe, Jackie Gleason, and in 
the role Catherine Ernshaw, Lucille 
Ball.
DYER:
(expressionless)
I've seen it.
Kinderman stares limply for a moment, then looks away.
KINDERMAN:
(murmuring)
Another one.
Then Kinderman steps up to the sidewalk, hooks an arm through 
Dyer's and slowly starts walking him down the street. CAMERA 
TRACKING FRONT.
KINDERMAN:
(fondly)
I’m reminded of a line in the film 
Casablanca. At the end Humphrey 
Bogart says to Claude Rains, 'Louie 
— I think this is the beginning of 
a beautiful friendship.'
FIXED REAR SHOT
As Kinderman and Dyer walk away from us*
DYER:

You know, you look a little bit 
like Bogart.
KINDERMAN:
You noticed.
