GUY and ROSEMARY WOODHOUSE enter the main gate of the 
Bramford.
EXT. BRAMFORD ENTRANCE HALL - (DAY)

MR. NICKLAS is a small and dapper man; his fingers missing 
from both hands.
MR. NICKLAS
Oh, an actor.
(Ringing for the elevator 
with his middle finger)
We’re very popular with actors. 
Have I seen you in anything?
GUY
Let’s see. I did Hamlet a while 
back, didn’t I, Liz? And then we 
made The Sandpiper...
ROSEMARY
He’s joking, he was in "Luther" and 
"Nobody Loves an Albatross” and a 
lot of television plays and 
commercials.
The elevator doors slide open. They enter.
MR. NICKLAS
That’s where the money is, isn’t 
it? The commercials.
ROSEMARY
Yes.
GUY
And the artistic thrill, too.
Rosemary gives him a pleading look? he gives back one of 
stunned innocence and then makes a leering vampire face at 
the top of Mr. Nicklas’ head.

Oak-paneled9 with a shining brass handrail - is run by a 
uniformed Negro boy, DIEGO, with a locked-in- place smile.
MR. NICKLAS
Seven
(To Rosemary and Guy)
Originally the smallest apartment 
was a nine - they've been broken up 
into fours, fives, and sixes. Seven 
E is a four that was originally the 
back part of a ten. It has the 
original master bedroom for its 
living room, another bedroom for 
its bedroom, and two servants’ 
rooms thrown together for its 
dining room or second bedroom. Do 
you have children?
ROSEMARY
We plan to.
The elevator stops and DIEGO, smiling, chivvies it down, up 
and down again for a closer alignment.
INT. HALLWAY - (DAY)

4
Dimly lighted, walled and carpeted in dark green. They pass a 
sculptured green door marked Seven B. A WORKMAN is fitting a 
periscope into it. He looks at them and turns back to the 
cut-out hole.
Mr. Nicklas leads the way to the right and then to the left, 
through short branches of dark greenhall­ way. The wallpaper 
is rubbed away and curling inward in places. One of the bulbs 
in a cut-glass sconce is dead. The dark green carpet is 
patched with light green tape. Guy looks at Rosemary and 
lifts his eye­ brows in mock outrage. She looks away and 
smiles brightly with an I-love-it-everything's-lovely 
expression.
MR. NICKLAS
The previous tenant, Mrs. Gardenia, 
passed away only a few days ago and 
nothing has been moved yet. Her son 
asked me to say that some of the 
furniture can be had practically 
for the asking.
They reach the door of apartment Seven E.
ROSEMARY
Did she die in the apartment? Not 
that it -
3.
MR. NICKLAS
Oh, no, in a hospital.
Mr. Nicklas presses the pearl bell=button (the name L. 
Gardenia is mounted above it on black plastic)
MR. NICKLAS
She’d been in a coma for weeks.
Mr. Nicklas turns a key in the lock. Despite lost fingers he 
works the knob and throws the door smartly.
MR. NICKLAS
After you, please. She was very old 
and passed away without ever 
waking.
INT. THE APARTMENT - (DAY)
5

Four rooms divided two and two on either side of a narrow 
central hallway that extends in a straight line from the 
front door. The first room on the right is the kitchen. It 
has a six=burner gas stove with two ovens, a mammoth 
refrigerator, a monumental sink, dozens of cabinets, a high 
celling and a window on Seventh Avenue. On a chrome table, 
roped bales of "Fortune" and "Musical America." Opposite the 
kitchen, another room with windows facing onto a narrow 
courtyard, which has apparently been used as a combination 
study and greenhouse. Hundreds of small plants, dying and 
dead, stand on jerry-built shelves under spirals of unlighted 
fluorescent tubing; in their midst a roll-top desk spilled 
over with books and papers.
As they are looking through the apartment, Mr. Nicklas 
continues:
MR. NICKLAS
I’ll be grateful to go that way 
myself when the time comes. She was 
chipper right to the end... She’d 
been one of the first women lawyers 
in New York State.
Rosemary nudges Guy and indicates the desk. She leaves Guy 
and Mr. Nicklas and goes to it, stepping over a shelf of 
withered brown fronds. She touches the old wood. It is a 
handsome desk, broad and gleaming with age. On mauve paper, 
graceful blue penmanship "...than merely the intriguing 
pastime I believed it to be. I can no longer associate 
myself...” Rosemary catches herself snooping and looks up at 
Mr. Nicklas.
ROSEMARY
4.
Is this for sale?
MR. NICKLAS
I don’t know. I could find out for 
you.
GUY
It’s a beauty.
ROSEMARY
Isn’t it?
She looks about smiling.
MR. NICKLAS
It would make an ideal nursery.
ROSEMARY
White and yellow wallpaper would 
brighten it tremendously.
She looks at the closet filled with potted seedlings.
GUY
What are all these?
ROSEMARY
Herbs, mostly.
(Pointing)
Mint. Basil.
Further along the hall is a guest closet on the left and, on 
the right, a wide archway opening into the Living Room. Two 
large bay windows, small fireplace and high oak bookshelves.
ROSEMARY
Oh, Guy!
She finds Guy’s hand and squeezes it.
GUY
Mmm.
(NONCOMITTALLY BUT 
SQUEEZING BACK HER HAND)
MR. NICKLAS
The fireplace works, of course.
Mr. Nicklas, standing behind them, turns to the bed­ room 
opposite. Its windows are facing on to the same narrow 
courtyard as those of the study. The bathroom is beyond the 
living room; big and full of bulbous white brass-knobbed 
fixtures.
5.
ROSEMARY
It's a marvelous apartment! I love 
it
GUY
What she's trying to do is get you 
to lower the rent.
MR. NICKLAS
(Smiling)
We would raise it if we were 
allowed. Apartments with this kind 
of charm -
Mr. Nicklas stops short and looks at a mahogany secretary at 
the head of the central hallway.
MR. NICKLAS
That's odd. There's a closet behind 
that secretary. I'm sure there is.
Mr. Nicklas goes closer to the secretary. Guy stands on 
tiptoe.
GUY
You're right.
ROSEMARY
She moved it. It used to be there.
She points to a peaked silhouette left ghost-like on the wall 
near the bedroom door, and the deep prints of four ball feet 
in the burgundy carpet. Faint scuff-trails curve and cross 
from the four prints to the secretary's feet where they stand 
now against the narrow adjacent wall.
MR. NICKLAS
Give me a hand, will you?
Guy and Mr. Nicklas, between them, work the secretary bit by 
bit back toward its original place.
GUY
I see why she went into a coma.
MR. NICKLAS
She couldn't have moved this by 
herself. She was eighty-nine.
Rosemary looks doubtfully at the closet door they have 
uncovered.
ROSEMARY
6.
Should we open it? Maybe her son 
should.
The secretary lodges in its four footprints. Mr. Nicklas 
massages his hands.
MR. NICKLAS
I'm authorized to show the 
apartment.
He goes to the door and opens it. The closet is nearly empty; 
a vacuum cleaner at one side and four wood boards at the 
other. The overhead shelf is stacked with blue and green bath 
towels.
GUY
Whoever she locked in got out.
MR. NICKLAS
She probably didn't need five 
closets.
ROSEMARY
Why would she cover up her vacuum 
cleaner and her towels?
MR. NICKLAS
(Shrugging)
I don't suppose we'll ever know. 
She may have been getting senile 
after all.
(Smiles)
Is there anything else?
ROSEMARY
Yes. What about the laundry 
facilities?
EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - (DAY)

Rosemary and Guy walk along.
ROSEMARY
It's cheaper than the other.
GUY
It's one room less, honey.
They walk in silence for a moment.
ROSEMARY
It’s better located.
7.
GUY
God, yes. I could walk to all the 
theatres.
ROSEMARY
Oh, Guy. Let’s take it! Please! 
That living room could be - oh 
please, let’s take it, all right?
GUY
Well, sure. If we can get out of 
the other lease.
INT. NEW YORK CAFE - (DAY)

Rosemary sitting at a table. There are two Bloody Mary’s in 
front of her. She is looking anxiously at the telephone booth 
at the end of the room. Guy is inside the booth talking on 
the phone. Rosemary at the table. She keeps her fingers 
crossed.
A PREGNANT WOMAN passes in a navy blue dress, followed by her 
MOTHER, carrying packages. Rosemary watches them.
JOAN JELLICO, a red-haired girl, waves to Rosemary from a 
table opposite. Rosemary waves back. Joan Jellico mimes I’ll-
come-to-see-you. A starved-looking, waxen-faced MAN facing 
Joan Jellico turns to look at Rosemary.
Rosemary looks toward the telephone booth again. Guy is on 
his way back, biting back a grin.
ROSEMARY
Yes?
GUY
The lease is void. We’ll get back 
the deposit.
ROSEMARY
What did you tell them?
Guy sits down. A WAITRESS brings sandwiches.
GUY
I’m leaving for Vietnam on a U.S.O. 
tour and you’re going to Omaha to 
stay with your folks.
ROSEMARY
Is that all?
GUY
8.
No. When I’m in Saigon I’m to keep 
an eye open for Lieutenant Hartman 
of the Marine Corps.
Joan Jellico reaches the table and bends over it.
JOAN
Hi!
Guy turns to see who it is.
GUY
Joan!
JOAN
Where have you been hiding?
ROSEMARY
How’s Dick?
JOAN
Okay.
GUY
Sit down.
JOAN
(Indicates over shoulder)
I'm with my agent. How are you 
doing?
ROSEMARY
Guess what? We’ve just got an 
apartment in the Bramford.
JOAN
You haven't! I’d die to live in the 
Bram!
ROSEMARY
I 'm so excited.
JOAN
(Looks over her shoulder)
Call me, Rosemary, I’ll help you 
move.
INT. HUTCH’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - (NIGHT) - AUGUST 5, 196£

9.
Small, well-equipped and slightly old-fashioned. Guy is 
leaning against a tall refrigerator, glass of wine in his 
hand. Rosemary is sitting on a stool, also with wine. HUTCH, 
wearing an apron and one oven glove, is bent double, looking 
in the oven. He is English, has a broad shiny face and a few 
strands of wetted-down hair combed crossways over his skull.
HUTCH
I was tempted to write the manage‐­
ment that you were drug addicts and 
litterbugs.
Rosemary and Guy laugh.
HUTCH
Instead, I lied and said that you’d 
be wonderful tenants.
ROSEMARY
You're great, Hutch.
HUTCH
I hope though, that I can talk you 
out of it.
GUY
(To Rosemary)
He's pulling your leg.
HUTCH
I'm not indeed.
Hutch straightens up, red-faced, perspiring, holding a large 
joint of lamb.
GUY
Gee, that looks great.
Hutch, holding the joint out in front of him, leads the way 
into the other room.
This is small, dark and neat. There is an inscribed photo of 
Winston Churchill and a period sofa. Two bridge tables, each 
with its typewriter and piles of paper. There is another 
table at the side, laid for dinner and looking out of place. 
Hutch goes to this table and. puts down the joint.
HUTCH
Are you aware that the Bramford had 
rather an unpleasant reputation 
early in the century?
Hutch looks at them; Rosemary sits down and Guy is pouring 
more wine into the glasses. Hutch starts carving.
10.
HUTCH
It's where the Trench sisters 
performed their little dietary 
experiments, and Keith Kennedy held 
his parties. Adrian Marcato lived 
there too; so did Pearl Ames.
GUY
Who were the Trench sisters?
ROSEMARY
Who was Adrian Marcato?
HUTCH
The Trench sisters were two proper 
Victorian ladies. They cooked and 
ate several young children, 
including a niece.
GUY
Lovely.
HUTCH
Adrian Marcato practiced 
witchcraft. He made quite a splash 
in the nineties, announcing he had 
conjured up the living Satan. 
Apparently people be­lieved him; so 
they attacked and nearly killed him 
in the Bramford lobby.
ROSEMARY
You're joking.
HUTCH
Later the Keith Kennedy business 
began, and by the twenties the 
house was half empty.
GUY
I knew about Keith Kennedy, I 
didn't know Marcato lived there.
ROSEMARY
(Shuddering)
And those sisters!
Hutch sits down and they start eating.
HUTCH
World War Two filled the place up 
again.
ROSEMARY
11.
Mmm. Terrific.
GUY
The house?
ROSEMARY
The lamb.
HUTCH
It was called Black Branford.
ROSEMARY
But - awful things happen in every 
apartment house.
HUTCH
The house happens to have a high 
incidence of unpleasant happenings. 
Why deliberately enter a danger 
zone?
GUY
Danger zone! Sounds like something 
out of your boys’ stories. You must 
be kidding.
HUTCH
I am honestly trying to talk you 
out of it.
GUY
Well, Jesus, Hutch --
HUTCH
Go to the Wyoming or the Osborne if 
you’re dead set on nineteenth 
century splendor.
ROSEMARY
The Wyoming is co-op. The Osborne 
is going to be torn down.
They eat for a moment in silence.
HUTCH
In ’59 a dead infant was found 
wrapped in newspaper in the 
basement.
GUY
You really rouse my appetite!
HUTCH
Have some more wine.
12.
Hutch refills the glasses.

Rosemary lies, bouncing up and down, on a huge bed.
Elise Dunstan, Joan Jellico and a SALESMAN stand watching 
her.
ROSEMARY
(Sitting up)
This is too big.
She looks at the Salesman and points to a bed opposite
ROSEMARY
What about this one?
JOAN
Oh no. You want a king-size bed.
SALESMAN
(Pointing to the smaller 
bed)
If your husband is not a heavy 
person, this is quite comfortable 
for two people.
JOAN
What happens if there are three?
SALESMAN

What do you mean? The baby?
The girls burst into laughter.
INT. GUY AND ROSEMARY’S APARTMENT - (DUSK) - AUGUST 20, 1965

Guy and Rosemary enter. He is carrying a lamp and a shopping 
bag. Rosemary pulls the key out of the door and follows Guy 
along the hallway. The apartment is empty, except for a few 
pieces of furniture in the den, from Mrs. Gardenia's son. The 
rooms are dark and full of shadows. Faint blue light comes 
through the win­ dows. Guy turns into the living room, 
Rosemary to the bedroom; there are many packages spread on 
the floor (results of the shopping) and a solitary vanity.
Rosemary kneels, opens a wooden crate, and pulls out three 
plates from the shavings. Guy comes in; she hands him the 
plates and starts putting back the shavings. We hear a 
woman’s voice from behind the wall.
MRS. CASTEVET (O.S.)
Roman? Bring me in some root beer 
when you come!
Guy and Rosemary look at each other.
GUY
I didn't know they were still 
making Ma and Pa Kettle movies.
He goes back to the living room. Rosemary follows him. On her 
way, she stops and looks toward the closet at the end of the 
hallway. She goes to it and opens it slowly. She takes out 
one of the four boards leaning against the side, turns it and 
looks at it.
Guy has plugged the lamp in the living room and a light comes 
through the archway.
ROSEMARY
Hey, these are shelves!
Rosemary brings the shelf into the Living Room, puts it on 
the floor; they picnic on it - tuna sandwiches and beer - 
sitting on the rug.
ROSEMARY
Let's make love!
They unplug the lamp, strip and start making love.
Wide-eyed with fear, Guy hisses.
14.
GUY
Shh! I hear - the Trench sisters 
chewing!
Rosemary hits him on the head, hard.
INT. GUY AND ROSEMARY’S APARTMENT - (DAY) - AUGUST 25, 1965

Big splash, of paint on the wall; the PAINTERS are work­ing in 
the living room. The CARPET LAYER unrolls carpet on the floor 
in the bedroom. THREE WORKMEN carrying an enormous bed and 
chairs in the hallway. A PAPER­ HANGER, grumbling, hangs 
wallpaper in the bedroom.
Rosemary, standing on a table, hangs curtains in the den. We 
hear the sound of a television commercial.
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Discover the swinging world of 
Yamaha...
Rosemary drops everything, jumps down from the table, and 
hunkers down in front of the television set. She waits for 
Guy to appear. When the commercial is finished, she switches 
off.
INT. KITCHEN - (DUSK) - AUGUST 30, 1965

Completely furnished and equipped. Rosemary is wash ing 
salad. There are preparations for dinner on the table. A 
large potted plant stands on the fridge and a smaller one on 
the floor.
Guy comes in. Rosemary, holding her dripping hands away, 
kisses him. She points to the large plant.
ROSEMARY
From Joan and Dick Jellico.
(Pointing to the smaller 
one)
From your agent.
GUY
Alan? Stingy bastard.
Rosemary turns and picks up a telegram, holding it carefully 
by the corner with her wet hand. She hands it to Guy.
ROSEMARY
From Hutch.
Guy looks at it.
15.
GUY
(Striking a pose)
"The Bramford will change from a 
bad house to a good house when one 
of its doors is marked R. and G. 
Woodhouse."
They both collapse in laughter.

Rosemary steps out of the elevator, carrying a large roll, of 
gingham contact paper. On the left, the GOULDS, a middle-aged 
couple, are coming out of an apartment door.
MR. GOULD
(Calling towards the 
elevator)
Hold it, hold it, pleased
They run towards the elevator, smiling at Rosemary. Rosemary 
smiles back at them. When the rolling gate closes, Rosemary 
goes to see their names on the door of their apartment. It 
says 3 MR. and MRS. GOULD. Rosemary turns back in her own 
direction and passing the door opposite the elevator, Seven 
A, looks for the name around the doorbell. There is no sign 
of any. Rosemary bends down and looks at the pile of mail on 
the doorstep. There are six to eight letters, with stamps of 
different countries. The name reads; MR. R. CASTEVET. A VOICE 
behind the door can be HEARD.
MRS. CASTEVET (O.S.)
Terry? Where's Terry?
Rosemary straightens up and moves on and looks at the door of 
Seven B. There is a little golden plate; MESSRS. DUBIN and 
DeVORE.

ROSEMARY

GUY
Mmm.
ROSEMARY
And Ma and Pa Kettle’s name is 
Castevet. They get a lot of mail. 
Who were Ma and Pa Kettle anyway?
Guy, reading, doesn’t answer. Rosemary waits for a moment.
ROSEMARY
Guy?
GUY
Yes, honey.
ROSEMARY
Oh, never mind!
INT. BASEMENT LAUNDRY ROOM - (DAY) - SEPTEMBER 10, 1965
19
19
Prison-like with steamy brick walls, bulbs in cages, and 
scores of deep double sinks in iron-mesh cubicles.
Rosemary is sitting reading the ’New Yorker’ next to an 
operating machine. TERRY, a girl Rosemary’s age, enters. She 
is dark-haired and looks like Anna Maria Alberghetti. Terry 
carries a yellow plastic laundry basket. She nods at Rosemary 
and then, not looking at her, goes to one of the machines and 
begins feeding dirty clothes into it.
Rosemary stares at the girl. Terry finishes putting in the 
clothes, closes the door, starts the machine; the water 
begins to fill up. Terry turns and catches Rosemary’s look 
and smiles questioningly.
ROSEMARY
I’m sorry. I thought you were Ama 
Maria Alberghetti. I’m sorry.
Terry blushes and looks at the floor.
17.
TERRY
It’s all right. Lot of people think 
I’m Anna Maria. I don’t see any 
resemblance.
ROSEMARY
Do you know her?
TERRY
No.
Terry wipes her hand on her shorts and steps forward, holding 
it out.
TERRY
I’m Terry Gionoffrio.
Rosemary smiles and shakes hands.
ROSEMARY
I’m Rosemary Woodhouse. We're new 
tenants here.
TERRY
I’m staying with Mr. and Mrs. 
Castevet. Seventh floor. I'm their 
guest, sort of, since June.
ROSEMARY
Oh, our apartment used to be the 
back part of yours.
TERRY
Oh, for goodness' sake. You took 
the old lady's apartments Mrs. -
ROSEMARY
Gardenia.
TERRY
Gardenia. She was a good friend of 
the Castevets. She used to grow 
herbs and things and bring them in 
for Mrs. Castevet to cook with.
ROSEMARY
I've seen those plants.
TERRY
Now Mrs. Castevet grows her own 
things.
ROSEMARY
18.
Excuse me, I have to put softener 
in.
Rosemary gets up and takes a bottle from the laundry bag on 
the washer. She pours a capful of softener. Terry opens the 
washer door.
ROSEMARY
(Tossing softener in)
Thank you.
TERRY
What does your husband do?
Capping the bottle Rosemary nods complacently.
ROSEMARY
He is an actor.
TERRY
No kidding? What’s his name?
ROSEMARY
Guy Woodhouse. He was in "Luther” 
and "Nobody Loves an Albatross” and 
he does a lot of television.
TERRY
Gee, I watch TV all day long. I’ll 
bet I’ve seen him.
Glass crashes somewhere in the basement.
TERRY
Yow.
Rosemary hunches her shoulders and looks uneasily toward the 
laundry room’s doorway.
ROSEMARY
I hate this basement.
TERRY
Listen, we could come down together 
regular.
ROSEMARY
That would be great.
Terry laughs happily, seems to seek words and then, still 
laughing:
TERRY
19.
I’ve got a good luck charm that'll 
maybe do for both of us!
She pulls away the collar of her blouse, draws out a silver 
neck chain and shows Rosemary on the end of it a silver 
filigree ball a little less than an inch in diameter.
ROSEMARY
Oh, that’s beautiful.
TERRY
Isn't it? Mrs. Castevet gave it to 
me. It's good luck, or anyway it's 
supposed to be. There's some stuff 
inside it.
Rosemary looks more closely at the charm Terry holds out 
between thumb and fingertips. It is filled with a greenish-
brown spongy substance which presses out against the silver 
openwork.
Rosemary draws back, wrinkling her nose. Terry LAUGHS again.
TERRY
I'm not mad about the smell either. 
I hope it works.
ROSEMARY
It's a beautiful charm. I’ve never 
seen anything like it.
TERRY
European.
She leans a hip against the washer and admires the ball, 
turning it one way and another.
TERRY
The Castevets are the most wonder‐­
ful people in the world, bar none. 
They picked me up off the sidewalk 
- literally.
ROSEMARY
You were sick?
TERRY
I was starving and on dope and 
doing a lot of other things. 
They’re childless. I'm like the 
daughter they never had, you know?
Rosemary nods.
20.
TERRY
I thought at first they had some 
kind of sex thing they would want 
me to do, but they've really been 
like real grandparents.
Terry drops the filigree ball back into her blouse.
ROSEMARY
It’s nice to know there are people 
like that, when you hear so much 
about apathy and people who are 
afraid of getting involved.
TERRY
I would be dead now if it wasn’t 
for them. That’s an absolute fact. 
Dead or in jail.
ROSEMARY
You don’t have any family that
- could have helped you?
TERRY
(Shrugging)
A brother in the Navy.

Guy is sitting in front of the TV set eating a bag of Fritos. 
Rosemary enters with Terry.
GUY
Them sure must be clean clothes.
ROSEMARY
This is Terry. This is Guy.
TERRY
Hello, Guy.
They shake hands. Terry blushes and turns to Rosemary, 
flustered.
TERRY
Of course I remember him. He was in 
- how was it called?
ROSEMARY
(To Guy)
Terry is staying with the 
Castevets. Seven A, you know.
21.
TERRY
'Another World' wasn’t it?
GUY
Are you sure it wasn’t Donald 
Baumgart?
TERRY
Oh, I thought it was you.
ROSEMARY
Of course it was Guy. He’s teasing 
you. Guy and Donald are reading for 
the same part.
TERRY
Oh, I’m sure you’ll get it.
(Looks round the 
apartment)
It’s a lovely apartment.
ROSEMARY
It will be. Have you seen it 
before?
TERRY
No.
GUY
You know, you remind me of some­ 
body.
TERRY
I’ve got to go now. The Castevets 
eat at six.
Rosemary opens the door.

Rosemary is unwrapping a tall teak wood ice bucket with a 
bright orange lining, on the table in the living room. Hutch 
is walking around admiring the half-furnished room. Rosemary 
goes to Hutch and kisses him.
ROSEMARY
Oh, Hutch! I'm so ashamed, we 
haven't had you over for dinner 
yet.
HUTCH
For God’s sake don’t even think 
about entertaining. Tell me, how is 
everything?
ROSEMARY
Guy's still auditioning. Nothing 
really exciting except for 
commercials, which is not too bad - 
money-wise.
HUTCH
It costs a fortune to furnish a 
place nowadays.
ROSEMARY
Ah, and the time... The chairs are 
four weeks late.
HUTCH
Typical.
ROSEMARY
The neighbors certainly don’t seem 
abnormal. Except normal abnormal 
like homosexuals. They breed 
Persian cats. We can have one any 
time we want,
HUTCH
They shed.
23.
ROSEMARY
And there’s a couple who took in 
this girl who was hooked on drugs, 
and they completely cured her.
HUTCH
It sounds as if you've moved into 
Sunnybrook Farm, I'm delighted.
ROSEMARY
The basement is kind of creepy, I 
curse you every time I go down 
there.
INT. BEDROOM - (NIGHT)

Guy in bed reading, Rosemary in front of her vanity mirror, 
brushing her hair. We hear a WOMAN’S voice behind the wall,
MRS. CASTEVET
(O.S.)
But it's impossible to be a hundred 
percent sure! if you want my 
opinion, we shouldn't tell her at 
all; that's my opinion!
The voice fades away. Guy lifts his head from his book; 
Rosemary turns round; they both look at the wall.
GUY
Jesus!
ROSEMARY
That must be the partition.
Guy pulls his pajama sleeves over his hands, leaving only one 
finger showing on each hand; imitating Mr. Nicklas’ voices:
GUY
(Pointing)
This is the back part of the 
original 'ten', with its master 
bedroom...
Rosemary, laughing, jumps into the bed and claps her hand 
over his mouth. Guy switches the lamp off. They kiss for a 
moment, then lift their heads in surprise; there is a sound 
of a party, flat unmusical singing and a flute or a clarinet 
piping along beside it.
EXT, STREET - (NIGHT) - SEPTEMBER 17, 1965

24.
Rosemary and Guy walk along approaching the Bramford. The 
night is mild and balmy. As they get nearer they see a group 
of about TWENTY PEOPLE gathered in a semi­ circle at the side 
of a parked car. Two police cars are double-parked, roof 
lights spinning red. Rosemary and Guy walk faster, hand in 
hand, straining to get a better view, Cars on the street slow 
questioningly; windows scrape open in the Bramford and heads 
look out beside gargoyle’s heads, The NIGHT DOORMAN, TOBY, 
comes from the house with a tan blanket, A POLICEMAN turns to 
take it from him. The roof of a Volkswagen is crumpled to the 
sides the windshield is crazed with a million fractures.
ONLOOKER
Dead,
2ND ONLOOKER
Gee, did you hear that crash. Wow.
Rosemary and Guy stand on tiptoes, craning over peoples’ 
shoulders.
POLICEMAN
Get back now, will you?
The shoulders separate, a SPORT-SHIRTED BACK moves away. On 
the sidewalk lies Terry, watching the sky with one eye, half 
of her face gone to red pulp. The blanket flips over her, 
settles, and red blotches soak through in one place and then 
another. Rosemary wheels, eyes shut, her right hand making an 
automatic cross. Her mouth is tightly closed.
GUY
Oh, Jesus. Oh my God.
POLICEMAN
Get back, will you?
GUY
We know her.
A SECOND POLICEMAN turns towards them. He is forty or so and 
sweating. His eyes are blue and beautiful, with thick, black 
lashes.
2ND POLICEMAN
What’s her name?
GUY
Terry.
2ND POLICEMAN
Terry what?
GUY
25.
Ro? What was her name? Terry what?
Rosemary opens her eyes and swallows.
ROSEMARY
I don’t remember. An Italian name,
GUY
She was staying with people named 
Castevet, in Seven A.
2ND POLICEMAN
We’ve got that already,
A THIRD POLICEMAN comes up holding a sheet of yellow 
notepaper, Mr. Nicklas is behind him, tight-mouthed, in a 
raincoat over striped pajamas.
3RD POLICEMAN
Short and sweet,
(Handing over notepaper)
She stuck it to the window sill 
with a band-aid.
The Third Policeman and Mr. Nicklas shake their heads.
The Second Policeman reads the sheet of paper, suck­ing 
thoughtfully at his front teeth.
2ND POLICEMAN
(With an Italian accent)
Theresa Gionoffrio.
MR. NICKLAS
(To Rosemary)
Did you know her?
ROSEMARY
Only slightly.
The Second Policeman opens his pad holder and puts the paper 
inside it. He closes the holder with a width of yellow 
sticking out.
Guy puts his hand on Rosemary’s back.
GUY
Come on, hon.
Rosemary and Guy nod to the 2nd Policeman and Mr. Nicklas and 
start towards the house.
MR. NICKLAS
Here they come now.
26.
Rosemary and Guy stop and turn,
An old couple is coming along the street.
MRS. CASTEVET is wrapped in light blue, with snow-white dabs 
of gloves, purse, shoes and hat. Nurselike she supports her 
husband’s forearm. He is dazzling, in an every-color 
seersucker jacket, red slacks, a pink bow tie, and a grey 
fedora with a pink band. He is seventy-five or older; she is 
sixty-eight or nine. They come closer with expressions of 
young alertness, with friend­ly quizzical smiles. The 2nd 
Policeman steps forward to meet them and their smiles falter 
and fall away, Mrs. Castevet says something worryingly; MR. 
CASTEVET frowns and shakes his head. His wide thin-lipped 
mouth is rosy-pink, as if lipsticked; his cheeks are chalky, 
his eyes small and bright in deep sockets. She is big­ nosed, 
with a sullen fleshy underlap. She wears pink­ rimmed 
eyeglasses on a neck chain that dips down from behind plain 
pearly earrings.
2ND POLICEMAN
Are you folks the Caste vets on the 
seventh floor?
MR. CASTEVET
We are.
(Dry voice that has to be 
listened for)
2ND POLICEMAN
You have a young woman named 
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?
MR. CASTEVET
We do. What’s wrong? Has there been 
an accident?
2ND POLICEMAN
You’d better brace yourselves for 
some bad news.
(He waits, looks at each 
of them in turn)
She’s dead. She killed herself.
(Raising a hand the thumb 
pointing back over his 
shoulder)
Jumped out of the window.
Mr. and Mrs. Castevet look at the 2nd Policeman with no 
change of expression at all, as if he hasn’t spoken yet; then 
Mrs. Castevet leans sideways, glancing beyond him at the red-
stained blanket. She stands straight again and looks him in 
the eyes.
27.
MRS. CASTEVET
That’s not possible.
(Loud midwestern accent)
It’s a mistake.
2ND POLICEMAN
(Without turning from 
her)
Artie, would you let these people 
take a look, please?
Mrs. Castevet marches past him, her jaw set. Mr. Castevet 
stays where he is.
MR. CASTEVET
I knew this would happen. She got 
deeply depressed every three weeks 
or so. I told my wife but she pooh-
poohed me.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Coming back)
That doesn’t mean that she killed 
herself. She was a very happy girl 
with no reason for self­-
destruction. She must have been 
cleaning the windows or something.
MR. CASTEVET
She wasn’t cleaning windows at 
midnight.
MRS. CASTEVET
Why not? Maybe she was!
The 2nd Policeman takes the yellow paper from his holder and 
holds it out. Mrs. Castevet hesitates, then takes it and 
turns it round to read it. Mr. Castevet tips his, head in 
over her arm and reads it too, his thin vivid lips moving.
2ND POLICEMAN
Is that her handwriting?
Mrs. Castevet nods.
MR. CASTEVET
Definitely. Absolutely.
The 2nd Policeman holds out his hand and Mrs. Castevet gives 
him the paper.
2ND POLICEMAN
Thank you. I’ll see you get it back 
when we’re done with it.
28.
Mrs. Castevet takes off her glasses, dropping them on their 
neck-chain and covering both her eyes with white-gloved 
fingertips.
MRS. CASTEVET
I don’t believe it. I just don’t 
believe it. She was so happy.
Mr. Castevet puts his hand on her shoulder, looks at the 
ground and shakes his head.
2ND POLICEMAN
Who is the next-of-kin?
MRS. CASTEVET
She was all alone. She didn’t have 
anyone, only us.
ROSEMARY
Didn't she have a brother?
Mrs. Castevet puts on her glasses and looks at her. Mr. 
Castevet looks up from the ground, his deep-socketed eyes 
glinting under his hat brim.
2ND POLICEMAN
Did she?
ROSEMARY
She said she did. In the Navy.
The 2nd Policeman looks to the Castevets.
MRS. CASTEVET
It’s news to me.
2ND POLICEMAN
(To Rosemary)
Do you know where he’s stationed?
ROSEMARY
No, I don't.
(To Castevets)
She mentioned him to me in the 
laundry room. I'm Rosemary 
Woodhouse.
GUY
We're in Seven E.
ROSEMARY
29.
I feel just the way you do, Mrs. 
Castevet. She seemed so happy and 
full of - of - she said wonderful 
things about you and your husband; 
how grateful she was.
MRS. CASTEVET
Thank you.
2ND POLICEMAN
You know anything about this 
brother except he’s in the Navy?
ROSEMARY
No.
MR. CASTEVET
It should be easy to find him.
Guy puts his hand on Rosemary's back and they begin to 
withdraw towards the house.
ROSEMARY
I’m so stunned and so sorry.
GUY
It’s such a pity. It’s -
MRS. CASTEVET
Thank you.

Guy is asleep but Rosemary lies awake beside him, she sees: 
Terry’s pulped face and her one eye watching the sky. (This 
is the first shot leading to the dream sequence.) Sister 
Agnes is shaking her fist at Rosemary.
SISTER AGNES
(Mrs. Castevet’s voice)
Sometimes I wonder how come you’re 
the leader of anything?
A bump on the other side of the wall wakes Rosemary.
MRS. CASTEVET (O.S.)
And please don’t tell me what 
Laura-Louise said because I'm not 
interested?
Rosemary turns over and burrows into her pillow.
30.
INT. DREAM SEQUENCE (?)
26
26
Set in a composite of Our Lady’s School, Uncle Mike's Body 
Shop and the candy counter in the Orpheum Cinema.
MASONS are bricking up the windows. Sister Agnes is furious. 
She squeezes her piggy-eyes and shouts.
SISTER AGNES
If you’d listened to me, we 
wouldn’t have had to do this!
(She points to the 
window)
We’d have been all set to go now 
in­ stead of starting all over from 
scratch!
UNCLE MIKE tries to hush her. Other SISTERS and GIRLS are 
standing a little apart listening to the argument.
SISTER AGNES
I told you not to tell her anything 
in advance.
(She points at SISTER 
VERONICA who stands with 
her head lowered)
I told you she wouldn’t be open-
minded.
Uncle Mike looks questioningly at Rosemary. Rosemary starts 
to explain to him in a hushed voice.
ROSEMARY
I told Sister Veronica about the 
windows and she withdrew the school 
from the competition. Otherwise we 
would have won.
Uncle Mike looks at Sister Veronica questioningly who spreads 
her hands out wide in a helpless gesture. By this time we are 
already in Uncle Mike's body shop.
SISTER AGNES
(Shouting)
Anybody! Anybody! All she has to be 
is young, healthy, and not a 
virgin. She doesn’t have to be a 
no-good-drug-addict whore out of 
the gutter.
Uncle Mike is shocked. Rosemary turns and she is at the candy 
counter with the other children.

INT. KITCHEN - (DAY) - SEPTEMBER 20, 1965

Rosemary is washing the vegetables. The bell rings. She goes 
to the door and looks through the peephole.
Mrs. Gastevet, white hair in curlers under a blue-and-white 
kerchief, looks solemnly straight ahead as if posing for a 
photograph. Rosemary opens the door.
ROSEMARY
Hello. How are you?
MRS. GASTEVET
Fine.
(She smiles bleakly)
May I come in for a minute?
ROSEMARY
Yes, of course; please do.
Rosemary holds the door wide open. Mrs. Gastevet comes in. 
She wears toreador pants; her hips and thighs are massive, 
slabbed with wide bands of fat.
The pants are lime-green under a blue blouse; the blade of a 
screwdriver pokes from her hip pocket.
They stop between the doorways of the den and the kitchen, 
Mrs. Gastevet puts on her neck chained glasses and smiles at 
Rosemary.
MRS. CASTEVET
I just came over to thank you for 
saying those nice things to us the 
other night.
ROSEMARY
Please, there’s no reason —
MRS. CASTEVET
Poor Terry. We thought maybe we had 
failed her in some way, although 
her note made it crystal clear we 
hadn't. You’ll never know how 
helpful it was, in such a shock 
moment. So I do thank you. Roman 
does too. Roman is my hubby.
Rosemary ducks her head in concession.
ROSEMARY
You're welcome. I’m glad I helped.
MRS. CASTEVET
32.
She was cremated yesterday. Now we 
have to forget and go on. It won’t 
be easy. We don’t have children of 
our own. Do you have any?
ROSEMARY
No, we don’t.
Mrs. Castevet looks into the kitchen. She points to the pans 
hanging on the wall.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, that’s nice. And look how you 
put the table, isn’t that 
interesting.
ROSEMARY
It was in a magazine.
MRS. CASTEVET
Nice paint job.
Mrs. Castevet fingers the door jamb appraisingly and turns to 
look into the den.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, that’s nice. A T.V. room.
ROSEMARY
It’s only temporary. It's going to 
be a nursery.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Looking at her)
Are you pregnant?
ROSEMARY
Not yet, but I hope to be, as soon 
as we’re settled.
MRS. CASTEVET
That’s wonderful. You’re young and 
healthy; you ought to have lots of 
children.
ROSEMARY
We plan to have three.
MRS. CASTEVET
I’m dying to see what you’ve done 
to this apartment. The woman who 
had it before was a dear friend of 
mine.
33.
ROSEMARY
I know.
(Leading her to the 
living room)
Terry told me.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, did she? You two had some long 
talks together in the laundry room.
ROSEMARY
Only one.
The living room startles Mrs. Castevet.
MRS. CASTEVET
My goodness! It looks so much 
brighter. What did you pay for a 
chair like that?
ROSEMARY
(Disconcerted)
I’m not sure. I think it was about 
two hundred dollars.
MRS. CASTEVET
You don’t mind my asking do you?
(She taps her nose)
That’s how I got a big nose, by 
being nosy.
INT. KITCHEN - (DAY)

Rosemary and Mrs. Castevet are sitting having coffee and 
cake.
MRS. CASTEVET
I knew it!
(Checking prices on the 
cans of soup and oysters)
I said it to Roman yesterday. He’s 
so good-looking! What movies was he 
in?
ROSEMARY
No movies. He was in two plays 
called ’Luther' and ’Nobody Loves 
An Albatross’ and he does a lot of 
television and radio.
MRS. CASTEVET
34.
Listen, Rosemary, I’ve got a two 
inch thick sirloin steak sitting 
defrosting right this minute. Why 
don’t you and Guy come over and 
have supper with us tonight, what 
do you say?
ROSEMARY
Oh, no. We couldn’t.
MRS. CASTEVET
Why not?
ROSEMARY
This is very kind but really —
MRS. CASTEVET
It would be a big help to us.
Mrs., Castevet looks into her lap, then looks up at Rosemary 
with a hard-to-carry smile.
MRS. CASTEVET
This’ll be the first night we’ll be 
alone since -
ROSEMARY
(Leaning forward 
feelingly)
If you’re sure it won’t be trouble 
for you.
MRS. CASTEVET
Honey, if it was trouble I wouldn’t 
ask you.
ROSEMARY
I’ll have to check with Guy, but 
you go ahead and count on us.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Standing up)
Listen! You tell him I won't take 
no for an answer!
Mrs. Castevet moves toward the door. Rosemary accompanies 
her. Mrs. Castevet reaches the door and opens it herself.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, here’s your mail, dear.
(She picks it up)
Ads.

Guy come in, kisses Rosemary and goes straight into the 
living room. Rosemary goes into the kitchen. Guy calls out 
from the living room.
GUY
Donald Baumgart got that part.
Rosemary doesn’t answer immediately., She comes into the 
living room carrying a sandwich and a glass of beer which she 
gives to Guy, sitting in the new chair.
ROSEMARY
It’s a bad play anyway.
GUY
Even if it folds out of town, it’s 
the kind of part that gets noticed.
Guy opens the corner of his sandwich, looks in bitterly, 
closes it, and starts eating.
ROSEMARY
Mrs. Castevet was here. To thank me 
for what I said about Terry. She’s 
the nosiest person I’ve ever seen. 
She actually asked the prices of 
things.
GUY
No kidding.
Rosemary kneels on the floor between the bay windows, drawing 
a line on brown paper with crayon and a yard­ stick and then 
measuring the depth of the window seats.
ROSEMARY
She invited us to have dinner with 
them.
(She looks at Guy)
I told her I’d have to check with 
you, but that it would probably be 
okay.
GUY
Ah, Jesus, Ro, we don't want to do 
that, do we?
ROSEMARY
I think they’re lonely.
GUY
36.
Honey, if we get friendly with an 
old couple like that we’re never 
going to get them off our necks, 
they’re right across the wall!
ROSEMARY
I told her she could count on us.
GUY
I thought you told her you had to 
check first.
ROSEMARY
I did, but I told her she could 
count on us too.
GUY
Well, it’s not my night for being 
kind to Ma and Pa Kettle. I’m 
sorry, honey.
ROSEMARY
All right, I'll tell her.
Rosemary draws another line with the crayon and the 
yardstick. Guy finishes his sandwich.
GUY
You don’t have to sulk about it.
ROSEMARY
I’m not sulking. I see exactly what 
you mean.
GUY
Oh, hell. We’ll go.
ROSEMARY
No, no, what for?
GUY
We ’ll go.
ROSEMARY
We don’t have to if you don’t want 
to. That sounds so phony but I 
really mean it, really I do.
GUY
It’ll be my good deed for the day.
ROSEMARY
37.
Only if you want- to. And we ’ll 
make it clear that it’s only this 
one time and not the beginning of 
any­ thing. Right?
GUY
Right.

Guy and Rosemary at the Castevet's door. Guy rings the bell. 
The elevator behind them clangs open and MR. DeVORE comes out 
carrying a suit swathed in cleaner’s plastic. He smiles and 
unlocks the door of Seven B next to them.
MR. DEVORE
You’re in the wrong place, aren’t 
you?
Rosemary and Guy make friendly laughs.
Mr. DeVore lets himself in, calling out.
MR. DEVORE
Me!
As the door is ajar we get a glimpse of a black sideboard and 
red and gold wallpaper.
Mrs. Castevet opens the door. She is powdered and rouged and 
smiling broadly. She is wearing light green silk with a 
frilled pink apron.
MRS. CASTEVET
Perfect timing! Come on in! Roman’s 
making Vodka Blushes. My, I’m glad 
you could come, Guy! I’m fixing to 
tell people I knew you when!
Guy and Rosemary laugh and exchange glances. They enter.
INT. CASTEVET’S APARTMENT - (DUSK)

A large foyer with a rectangular table set for four.
38.
It has an embroidered white cloth, plates that don’t all 
match, and bright ranks of ornate silver. The room is oddly 
furnished? at the fireplace end. there is a settee, a lamp 
table and a few chairs. At the opposite end an office-like 
clutter of file cabinets, bridge tables piled with 
newspapers, overfilled book­ shelves and a typewriter on a 
metal stand. There are clean squares on the walls as if 
pictures had been removed.
Mrs. Castevet shows them across the brown carpet and seats 
them on the settee; Mr. Castevet comes in, hold ing in both 
hands a small tray on which four cocktail glasses run over 
with clear pink liquid. Staring at the rims of the glasses he 
shuffles forward across the carpet, looking as if with every 
step he will trip and fall disastrously, Mr, Castevet is 
wearing black loafers with tassels, gray slacks, a white 
blouse, and a blue and gold striped ascot.
MR. CASTEVET
I seem to have overfilled the 
glasses. No, no, don’t get up. 
Please. Gen­erally I pour these out 
precisely as a bartender, don’t I, 
Minnie?
MRS. CASTEVET
Just watch the carpet,
MR. CASTEVET
But this evening I made a little 
too much and rather... I'm 
afraid... there we are. Please, sit 
down. Mrs. Woodhouse?
Rosemary takes the glass, thanks him and sits. Mrs. Castevet 
quickly puts a paper cocktail napkin in her lap.
MR. CASTEVET
Mr. Woodhouse? A Vodka Blush. Have 
you ever tasted one?
GUY
(Taking one and sitting)
No.
MR. CASTEVET
Minnie.
ROSEMARY
It looks delicious,
Rosemary smiles vividly as she wipes the base of her glass.
MR. CASTEVET
39.
They’re very popular in Australia.
Mir. Castevet takes the final glass and raises it to Rosemary 
and Guy.
MR. CASTEVET
To our guests. Welcome to our home.
Mr. Castevet drinks, cocking his head critically, one eye 
partway closed, the tray at his side dripping on the carpet.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Coughing in mid-swallow)
The carpet!
Mrs. Castevet chokes and points at the carpet.
Mr. Castevet looks down, then holds the tray up un­ certainly.
MR. CASTEVET
Oh, dear.
Mrs. Castevet thrusts aside her drink, hurries to her knees 
and lays a paper napkin carefully over the wetness.
MRS. CASTEVET
Brand-new carpet. This man is so 
clumsy.
ROSEMARY
Do you come from Australia?’
MR. CASTEVET
Oh no.
(Sitting and crossing his 
legs)
I’m from right here in New York 
City. I've been there though. I've 
been everywhere. Literally.
(He sips the Vodka Blush, 
one hand on his knee)
You name a place and I've been 
there. Go ahead. Name a place.
GUY
Fairbanks, Alaska.
MR. CASTEVET
I've been there. I've been all over 
Alaska? Fairbanks, Juneau, 
Anchorage, Nome, Seward? I spent 
four months there in '38.
MRS. CASTEVET

Where are you folks from?
(Fixing the folds at the 
bosom of her dress)
ROSEMARY
I'm from Omaha. Guy is from 
Baltimore.
MR. CASTEVET
Omaha is a good city, Baltimore is 
too.
ROSEMARY
Do you travel for business?
MR. CASTEVET
Business and pleasure both, I’m 
seventy-nine and I've been going 
one place or another since I was 
ten. You name it, I've been there.
A bell pings in the kitchen.

MR. CASTEVET
No Pope ever visits a city where 
the newspapers are on strike.
MRS. CASTEVET
I heard he's going to postpone and 
wait till it’s over.
GUY
Well, that's showbiz.
Mr. and Mrs. Castevet laugh, Guy along with them.
Rosemary smiles and cuts her steak. It is difficult to cut, 
and flanked by peas and mashed potatoes.
From her expression we can gather it doesn't taste good 
either.
41.
MR. CASTEVET
(Still laughing)
That's just what it is. The 
costumes, the rituals.
MRS. CASTEVET
I think we're offending Rosemary.
ROSEMARY
No, no, not at all.­
MR. CASTEVET
You aren't religious, my dear, are 
you?
ROSEMARY
I was brought up a Catholic, now I 
don’t know.
MRS. CASTEVET
(To Rosemary)
You looked uncomfortable.
Mrs. Castevet stands up and starts to collect the empty 
plates.
ROSEMARY
Well, he is the Pope.
MR. CASTEVET
You don't need to have respect for 
him because he pretends he is holy.
GUY
Good point.
MRS. CASTEVET
When I think what they spend on 
robes and jewels.
Mrs. Castevet serves the dessert; Boston cream pie.
MR. CASTEVET
A good picture of the hypocrisy 
behind organized religion was 
given. I thought in ’Luther'. Did 
you ever get to play the leading 
parts. Guy?
GUY
Me? No.
MR. CASTEVET
42.
Weren’t you Albert Finney’s 
understudy?
GUY
No.
We can see from Rosemary's expression that the Boston cream 
pie isn’t too good. She looks at Guy but he is eating away 
avidly.
MR. CASTEVET
That’s strange. I remember being 
struck by a gesture you made and 
checking in the program to see who 
you were.
GUY
What gesture do you mean?
MR. CASTEVET
I'm not sure now^ a movement of 
your -
GUY
I used to do a thing with my arms 
when Luther had the fit; a sort of 
involun­tary reaching -
MR. CASTEVET
That’s it! It had a wonderful 
authenticity to it.
GUY
Oh, come on now.
MR. CASTEVET
Oh no, I mean it.
GUY
That makes two of us.
Guy laughs but he is pleased. He casts a bright­ eyed glance 
at Rosemary. She smiles back.
Mrs. Castevet holds out the Boston cream pie towards Guy.
MRS. CASTEVET
Guy?
GUY
Oh yes, please.
Rosemary looks in surprise at Guy who is helping him­ self to 
the dessert.
43.
MR. CASTEVET
My father was a theatrical 
producer. My early years were spent 
in the company of such people as 
Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson, 
Modjeska. You have a most 
interesting inner quality, Guy. It 
appears in your television work 
too, and it should carry you very 
far indeed, provided, of course, 
that you get those initial 
’breaks'. Are you preparing for a 
show now?
GUY
I'm up for a couple of parts.
MR. CASTEVET
I can’t believe that you won’t get 
them.
GUY
I can.
INT. KITCHEN - (NIGHT)
33
33
It opens off the foyer. It1s small and it has the miniature 
greenhouse, which stands on a large white table near the one 
window. Goosenecked lamps with bright bulbs lean over it with 
a blinding white light, reflecting in the glass. In the 
remaining space the sink, stove and refrigerator stand close 
together with cabinets jutting out on all sides above them.
Mrs. Castevet stands at the sink washing up. Rosemary stands 
beside her drying. The pile of clean dishes beside her 
indicate that they have been in the kitchen for some time. 
While drying a dish, Rosemary turns and looks at the 
greenhouse.
ROSEMARY
I’d like to have a spice garden 
some day, I’m a country girl at 
heart.
MRS. CASTEVET
Do you come from a big family?
ROSEMARY
Three brothers and two sisters,
MRS. CASTEVET
Are your sisters married?
44.
ROSEMARY
Yes, they are,
Mrs. Castevet pushes a soapy sponge up and down inside a 
dinner glass. She is a slow and thorough washer.
Rosemary has to wait each time, towel in hand, for the next 
piece.
MRS. CASTEVET
Do they have children?
ROSEMARY
One has two and the other has four.
MRS. CASTEVET
Well, there’s a chance you will 
have lots of children too.
ROSEMARY
Oh, we’re fertile, all right. I’ve 
got twenty nieces and nephews.
MRS. CASTEVET
My goodness!
(Handing Rosemary the 
glass)
ROSEMARY
(Puts the glass on shelf)
Would you like me to wash and you 
wipe for a while?
MRS. CASTEVET
No, this is fine, dear.
Rosemary looks outside the door. She can see only the end of 
the living room that has bridge tables and file cabinets. Mr. 
Castevet and Guy are out of sight. A plane of blue cigarette 
smoke lies motionless in the air.
MRS. CASTEVET
Rosemary?
Rosemary turns. Mrs. Castevet, smiling, holds out a wet plate 
in a green rubber-gloved hand.
INT. LIVING ROOM - (NIGHT)
34
34
Mr. Castevet and Guy are sitting facing each other on the 
settee. Guy is looking at Mr. Castevet, fascin­ated. They 
smoke for the moment in silence. Rosemary appears in the 
doorway.
45.
MR. CASTEVET
Take Kennedy for example. Do you 
think it could have been a plot of 
some kind?
Mrs. Castevet comes past Rosemary into the room.
MRS. CASTEVET
Now Roman, you stop bending Guy’s 
ear with your Modjeska stories. 
He’s only listening 'cause he's 
polite.
GUY
No, it’s interesting, Mrs. 
Castevet.
MR. CASTEVET
You see?
MRS. CASTEVET
(To Guy)
Minnie, I’m Minnie and he's Roman, 
okay?
(Looking mock-defiantly 
at Rosemary)
Okay?
GUY
Okay, Minnie.
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CASTEVET'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)

Rosemary and Guy go along the hallway and the door closes 
behind them. They both give relieved sighs, look at each 
other and laugh.
GUY
Naow Roman, yew stop bendin’ Guy's 
ee-yurs with them thar Mojestky 
sto-rees!
Laughing, Rosemary hushes him. They run hand in hand on 
ultra-quiet tiptoes to their own door.
INT. GUY'S AND ROSEMARY'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
36

Rosemary and Guy slam, lock, bolt and chain the door; Guy 
nails it over with imaginary beams, pushes up three imaginary 
boulders, hoists an imaginary draw­ bridge, mops his brow and 
pants while Rosemary bends over double and laughs into both 
hands.
46.
GUY
About that steak.
ROSEMARY
Oh my God! The pie! How did you eat 
two pieces? It was weird!
Guy pretends that he is going to vomit and runs to the 
bedroom.
Rosemary works her feet against the floor to unshoe them.
ROSEMARY
Only three dinner plates that
match..
GUY
(Indicating wall)
Shhh —
ROSEMARY
(Whispering)
...and all that beautiful, 
beautiful silver.
GUY
Let’s be nice; maybe they'll will 
it to us.
ROSEMARY
Guess what they’ve got in the 
bathroom.
GUY
A bidet.
ROSEMARY
'Jokes for the John'.
GUY
No.
ROSEMARY
(Shucking off her dress)
A book on a hook. Right next to the 
toilet.
Guy smiles and shakes his head. He begins taking out his 
cufflinks, standing beside the armoire.
GUY
47.
Roman's stories were pretty damn 
interesting, actually. I’d never 
even heard of Forbes-Robertson 
before.
(Working at the second 
link, having trouble with 
it)
I’m going to go over there again 
tomorrow night and hear some more.
ROSEMARY
(Looking at him, 
disconcerted)
You are?
GUY
He asked me.
(Holding out his hand)
Can you get this off for me?
Rosemary goes to him and works at the link, feeling suddenly 
lost and uncertain.
ROSEMARY
I thought we were going to do 
something with Dick and Joan 
Jellico.
GUY
Was that definite?
ROSEMARY
It wasn't definite.
GUY
(Shrugging)
We’ll see them next week.
Rosemary gets the link out and holds it in her palm. Guy 
takes it.
GUY
Thanks. You don’t have to come 
along if you don’t want to; you can 
stay here.
ROSEMARY
I think I will. Stay here.
Rosemary goes to the bed and sits down.
GUY
He knew Henry Irving too. Really 
interesting.
48.
ROSEMARY
(Unhooking her stockings)
Why did they take down the 
pictures.
GUY
What do you mean?
ROSEMARY
Their pictures; they took them 
down. There are hooks in the wall 
and clean places. And the one 
picture that is there doesn’t fit.
GUY
(Looking at her)
I didn’t notice.

1965

Rosemary puts a record on, picks up a hook, sits on the new 
couch, puts up her feet and opens the book.
The doorbell rings. She remains motionless for a moment. 
Then, closes the book, gets up and goes to the door.
It’s Mrs. Castevet and another woman, short, plump and 
smiling, with a Buckley-for-Mayor button on the shoulder of 
her green dress.
MRS. CASTEVET
Hi, dear, we’re not bothering you, 
are we? This is my dear friend 
Laura-Louise McBurney, who lives up 
on twelve. Laura-Louise, this is 
Guy’s wife Rosemary.
LAURA-LOUISE
Hello, Rosemary, welcome to the 
Bram!
MRS. CASTEVET
Laura-Louise just met Guy and she 
wanted to meet you too. Can we come 
in?
With resigned good grace Rosemary shows them into the living 
room. Mrs. Castevet indicates a new couch.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, isn’t it beautiful!
49.
ROSEMARY
It came this morning.
MRS. CASTEVET
Are you all right, dear. You look 
worn.
ROSEMARY
I’m fine.
(Smiling)
It’s the first day of my period.
LAURA-LOUISE
And you’re up and around?
(Sitting)
On my first day I experienced such 
pain that I couldn’t move or eat or 
anything. Dan had to give me gin 
through a straw to kill the pain.
MRS. CASTEVET
Girls today take things more in 
their stride.
(Sitting)
They’re healthier than we were, 
thanks to vitamins and better 
medical care.
Both women have identical green sewing bags and, to 
Rosemary’s surprise, they open them now. Mrs. Castevet takes 
out darning and Laura-Louise takes out crocheting.
MRS. CASTEVET
What’s that over there? Seat 
covers?
ROSEMARY
Cushions for the window seats.
Rosemary stands for a moment undecidedly. She sits uneasily, 
trying to find a comfortable position.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, before I forget. This is for 
you. From Roman and me.
Mrs. Castevet hands Rosemary a small packet of pink tissue 
paper.
ROSEMARY
For me?
MRS. CASTEVET
It’s just a little present is all.
50.
(Quick hand-waves)
For moving in.
ROSEMARY
But there's no reason...
Rosemary unfolds the leaves of used-before tissue paper. 
Within the pink is Terry’s silver filigree ball-charm and. 
its clustered-together neck chain. She pulls her head away.
MRS. CASTEVET
It's real old. Over three hundred 
years.
Rosemary holds the ball between her thumb and finger­ tips 
like Terry did. She stares at it for a moment.
ROSEMARY
It's lovely.
MRS. CASTEVET
The green inside is called tannis 
root. It's good luck.
ROSEMARY
It's lovely, but I can't accept 
such a -
MRS. CASTEVET
You already have.
Mrs. Castevet darns a brown sock not looking at Rosemary.
MRS. CASTEVET
Put it on.
LAURA-LOUISE
You’ll get used to the smell before 
you know it.
MRS. CASTEVET
Go on.
ROSEMARY
Well, thank, you.
Rosemary uncertainly puts the chain over her head and tucks 
the ball into the collar of her dress.

Guy opens the door of the apartment, comes in and goes into 
the living room.
51.
The women are seated in different positions as before.
Rosemary is sewing the cushion covers and there's a tray with 
coffee pot and cups on the table. Guy says hello to the women 
and, by Rosemary’s chair, bends and kisses her cheek. He is 
quiet and a little self­ contained.
MRS. CASTEVET
Eleven? My land! Come on, Laura-
Louise.
LAURA-LOUISE
Come and visit me any time, you 
want, Rosemary; I’m in twelve F.
The two women close their sewing bags and leave quickly.
ROSEMARY
Were his stories as interesting as 
last night?
GUY
Yes. Did you have a nice time?
ROSEMARY
All right. I got a present.
She shows him the charm.
ROSEMARY
It was Terry’s.
GUY
No kidding! It's pretty though.
Rosemary lifts the chain off over her head and holds it out 
between two fingers, the ball dangling at the end of the 
chain.
GUY
Aren't you going to wear it?
ROSEMARY
It smells. There's stuff in it 
called tennis root. From her green­ 
house.
Guy smells it, and shrugs.
GUY
It's not bad.
52.
Rosemary goes into the bedroom and as she opens a drawer in 
the vanity, she catches her reflection in the mirror. She 
leans towards it and calls?
ROSEMARY
Tannis, anyone?
GUY
If you took it, you ought to wear 
it.
Rosemary turns? Guy is leaning against the door frame. 
Instead of answering Rosemary opens a tin Louis Sherry box in 
the drawer, puts the charm in the box, closes it and closes 
the drawer.
INT. BEDROOM - (NIGHT)

Rosemary wakes up and finds Guy beside her smoking in the 
dark.
ROSEMARY
What’s the matter?
GUY
Nothing.
A moment of silence, then she touches his arm.
ROSEMARY
Don’t worry.
GUY
About what?
ROSEMARY
About anything.
GUY
All right. I won’t.
ROSEMARY
You’re the greatest. You know? And 
it's going to come out right.
Guy smiles in the glow of his cigarette.
ROSEMARY
Any day now. Something big. 
Something worthy of you.
GUY
I know. Go to sleep, honey.
53.
ROSEMARY
Okay. Watch the cigarette.
GUY
I will.
ROSEMARY
I love you.
GUY
I love you, Ro.

Guy holds out a pair of theatre tickets to Rosemary.
GUY
Here, these are for the 'Fanta 
sticks”. Alan Stone gave them to me 
so why don't you call Hutch or 
somebody and go and see it.
ROSEMARY
Aren’t you going to see it with me?
GUY
I saw it ages ago.
INT. TAXI - DRIVING ALONG AN AVENUE - (NIGHT)

Elise Dunstan and Rosemary, dressed for the theatre in her 
summer silk coat, sitting in the back. There is a fat, old 
DRIVER listening to their conversation.
ELISE DUNSTAN
This is a break for me to get away 
from my three monsters.
ROSEMARY
That's what we’re going to have. 
Three, two years apart.
ELISE DUNSTAN
You’re not pregnant, are you?
ROSEMARY
I wish I was, Elise, Guy is "not 
ready yet”.
ELISE DUNSTAN
Well -
54.
ROSEMARY
I'm afraid he’ll never be ready, 
until he’s like Marlon Brando and 
Richard Burton put together.
They giggle.
ELISE DUNSTAN
All men feel the same way. You have 
plenty of time.
ROSEMARY
I have my little plan. I’m going to 
get pregnant by accident.
ELISE DUNSTAN
Are you taking pills?
Rosemary shakes her head.
ROSEMARY
I told Guy they give me a head­ 
ache, and the rubber gadgets are 
repulsive. So he studies the 
calendar like mad. But I’ll get him 
anyway.
(They laugh)
The Driver looks in the mirror and grins.
ELISE DUNSTAN
You mustn’t do that, Rosie, it’s a 
terrible thing to do to a man.
ROSEMARY
(Smiling)
It’s a contest between us.
ELISE DUNSTAN
Contest? He doesn’t know he's 
engaged in it.
EXT. THEATRE - (NIGHT)

The taxi stops in front of a theatre. There is a big 
illuminated sign with "The Fantasticks” and the names of 
artists.
Elise Dunstan and Rosemary get out of the cab and turn to pay

The Driver has a good look at Rosemary.

Rosemary and Elise Dunstan go into the theatre.

Rosemary, taking off her silk coat, goes into the Bathroom. 
Guy is getting out of the shower, wrapping himself in a 
towel. He kisses Rosemary vivaciously.
GUY
How was it?
ROSEMARY
Wonderful, wonderful. You worked on 
your scene?
GUY
Yes. I’ve got it down cold.
Rosemary sniffs.
ROSEMARY
Damn that tannis root. It’s even in 
here.
Rosemary goes to the Kitchen (tossing her coat on the way 
into the Bedroom).
ROSEMARY (O.S.)
(Calling)
Elise says that Joan and Dick 
Jellico are separating.
GUY
No kidding.
Rosemary comes back with some aluminum foil, and a deodorant 
bomb.
ROSEMARY
Lucky they didn’t have children,
She takes the charm out of the Louis Sherry box, winds it in 
a tight triple wrapping and twists the ends to seal it. Guy, 
comes Into the Bedroom, drying his hair with a towel.
GUY
It’ll probably lose its strength in 
a few days.
ROSEMARY
56.
It better. If not, I’ll throw it 
away,
As Rosemary puts the wrapped charm back in the box, standing 
behind her, Guy unzips her dress and pulls it off her 
shoulders; he starts kissing her neck. We HEAR a party in 
progress behind the wall; flat unmusical CHANTING, with a 
flute or clarinet underneath it.

Rosemary trying different arrangements with chairs.
The telephone RINGS in the Bedroom. Rosemary makes an 
involuntary move to answer it. Through the arch-way she sees 
Guy, can of paint remover in his hand, running to get to the 
phone.
GUY (O.S.)
(Quickly)
Yes? This is he.
(Long silence)
Oh, God, no. Oh, the poor guy.
Rosemary goes to the Bedroom door; Guy is sitting on the bed, 
the phone in one hand and a can of Red Devil paint remover in 
the other. He doesn’t look at Rosemary.
GUY
And they don’t have any idea what’s 
causing it? My God, that’s awful, 
just awful.
Guy straightens up, listening.
GUY
Yes I am.
(Listens)
Yes, I would. I'd hate to get it 
this way, but I -
(Listens again)
Well, you’d have to speak to my 
agent about that end of it.
(Listens)
57.
Alan Stone, but I’m sure there 
won’t be any problem, Mr. Weiss, 
not as far as we’re concerned.
Rosemary, standing in the doorway, holds her breath, waiting.
GUY
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.
Guy hangs up and shuts his eyes. He sits motionless, his hand 
staying on the phone. He is pale and dummy-like, a Pop Art 
wax statue with real clothes and props, real phone, real can 
of paint remover.
ROSEMARY
Guy?
He opens his eyes and looks at her.
ROSEMARY
What is it?
Guy blinks and comes alive.
GUY
Donald Baumgart. He’s gone blind. 
He woke up yesterday and - he can’t 
see.
They look painfully at each other.
ROSEMARY
Oh no.
GUY
I’ve got the part. It’s hell of a 
way to get it.
Guy looks at the paint remover in his hand and puts it on the 
night table.
GUY
Listen, I’ve got to get out and 
walk around.
ROSEMARY
I understand. Go ahead.
Rosemary stands back from the doorway. Guy goes out, down the 
hall, out the door, closing it behind him. Rosemary goes into 
the Living Room and sits down. She leans with arms folded on 
her knees, thinking. She remains motionless for a moment, 
then pronounces slowly, tasting the name.
58.
ROSEMARY
Baumgart. Donald Baum ...
She looks at the window, stands up and goes quickly to it. 
She opens the window and looks down at the quiet street.
INT. LIVING ROOM - (DAY) - SEPTEMBER 30, 1965

Guy Is sitting in an easy chair, cigarette between his 
fingers. He is motionless but his eyes follow Rosemary as she 
vacuum cleans the room. She works thoroughly, gradually 
moving toward the door. After she has dis­ appeared into the 
hall, the SOUND of the cleaner stops. Guy, still in the same 
position, slowly lifts the cig­arette to his mouth. Rosemary 
comes back without the cleaner. She walks slowly towards Guy 
and stands silently in front of him. They look at each other.
ROSEMARY
What’s wrong?
GUY
Nothing. Don’t you have your 
sculpture class today?
ROSEMARY
I haven’t gone in two months.
GUY
Why don’t you go?

Rosemary comes in, her coat still on and carrying a shopping 
bag. There are roses in a vase on the table.
Rosemary puts down the shopping bag and goes in sur­prise to 
examine them. She inhales their scent.
Taking off her coat, she goes into the Living Room.
There are roses there also. Guy comes in from the Bedroom, 
one rose in his hand, and kisses her.
GUY
I’ve been a creep. It’s from 
worrying Baumgart would regain his 
sight, rat that I am.
ROSEMARY
That's natural. You're bound to 
feel two ways about -
59.
Guy lifts the rose to her nose. Then he turns and walks 
toward the Kitchen. Rosemary follows him.
GUY
Listen, even if I’m Mister Yamaha 
for the rest of my days, I'm going 
to stop giving you the short end of 
the stick.
ROSEMARY
You haven’t -
GUY
Yes, I have. I’ve been too busy 
tearing my hair out over my career. 
Let's have a baby, okay? Let’s have 
three, one at a time.
Rosemary looks at him.
GUY
A baby. You know, Goo, goo? 
Diapers? Waa, waa?
ROSEMARY
Do you mean it?
GUY
Sure I mean it; I even figured out 
the right time to start. Look!
Guy turns towards the calendar hanging on the wall.
There are two days encircled with a red pencil. He taps them 
with his finger.
ROSEMARY
(Tears in her eyes)
You really mean it, Guy?
GUY
No, I'm kidding. Sure I mean it. 
Look, Rosemary, for God’s sake 
don’t cry, all right? Please.
ROSEMARY
All right.

Rosemary is sitting at her vanity, dressed in burgundy silk 
lounging pajamas. She makes up her eyes, powders her face and 
perfumes herself. She HEARS the front door open off-screen 
and goes out Into the hallway.
Guy has just come into the apartment. Rosemary meets him and 
they kiss.
GUY
Mmm, you look good enough to eat. 
Damn!
ROSEMARY
What?
GUY
I forgot the pie.
ROSEMARY
It's all right.
GUY
I passed two of those damn retail 
stores; not one but two.
ROSEMARY
We can have fruit and cheese. 
That's the best dessert anyway, 
really.
GUY
It is not; Horn and Hardart pump­ 
kin pie is.
Guy starts to undress; going into the Bathroom.

The table is set for dinner. Rosemary and Guy are drinking 
cocktails and eating stuffed mushrooms. Guy puts crumpled 
newspaper and sticks of kindling on the fireplace grate, and 
two big chunks of cannel coal.
GUY
Here goes nothing.
61.
He strikes a match and lights the paper. It flames high and 
catches the kindling. Dark smoke begins spilling out over the 
front of the mantel and up toward the ceiling. Guy gropes 
inside the fireplace.
GUY
Good grief!
ROSEMARY
The paint, the paint!
Guy gets the flue opened; and the air conditioner draws out 
the smoke.
GUY
Nobody, but nobody has a fire 
tonight.
Rosemary kneels, with her drink, and stares into the spitting 
flame-wrapped coals.
ROSEMARY
Isn’t it gorgeous? I hope we have 
the coldest winter ever.
Guy puts on a record.

Rosemary and Guy are at the dining table eating swordfish. 
The doorbell rings.
GUY
Oh! No!
He gets up, tosses down his napkin, goes out. Rosemary cocks 
her head and listens. We hear the do open off screen and Mrs. 
Castevet’s voice saying 'hi Guy'. The rest is unintelligible.
Rosemary lifts her eyes to heaven.
ROSEMARY
Oh, no!
(Whispering)
Don’t let her in.... not tonight.
Off screen dialogue continues. Now Guy speaks; then Mrs. 
Castevet again. Only a few words are intelligible "... extra. 
We don’t need them". Guy again and Mrs Castevet again. 
Rosemary holds in her breath. We hear the door being closed 
and chained.
ROSEMARY
62.
Good!
We hear the bolt drawn.
ROSEMARY
Good!
Guy appears in the archway, smiling smugly, with both hands 
behind his back.
GUY
Who says there’s nothing to ESP?
He comes towards the table and brings forth his hands with 
two white custard cups sitting one on each palm.
GUY
Madame and Monsieur shall have ze 
dessairt after all.
He puts one cup by Rosemary's wine glass and the other by his 
own. The cups are filled with peaked swirls of chocolate. One 
topped with a sprinkling of chopped nuts. The other with a 
half walnut.
GUY
Mousse au chocolat
(Sitting)
or ’chocolate mouse’, as Minnie 
calls it.
Rosemary laughs happily. Guy replaces his napkin and pours 
more wine.
ROSEMARY
I was afraid she’d stay all 
evening.
GUY
No, she just wanted us to try it, 
seein’ as how it’s one of her 
speci-al-ities.
ROSEMARY
It’s sweet of her, really. 
shouldn't make fun of her.
GUY
You’re right. You’re right.
Guy and Rosemary start eating the chocolate mousse.
ROSEMARY
It’s good.
63.
At the second spoonful, she pauses and looks at Guy but he is 
busy eating.
ROSEMARY
It has an undertaste.
Guy looks up at Rosemary.
GUY
Mmm?
ROSEMARY
A chalky undertaste.
Guy rolls the mousse on his palate, cocking his head.
GUY
I don't get it.
After a few swallows, Rosemary puts down her spoon.
GUY
That's silly, honey, there's no 
'undertaste'.
ROSEMARY
There is.
GUY
Come on, the old bat slaved all 
day; eat it.
ROSEMARY
But I don't like it.
GUY
It's delicious.
ROSEMARY
You can have mine.
GUY
All right, don't eat it. There's 
always something wrong.
ROSEMARY
Oh - if it's going to turn into a 
big scene -
She takes a full spoonful of mousse and. thrusts it into her 
mouth.
GUY
64.
Look, if you really can’t stand it, 
don't eat it.
ROSEMARY
Delicious.
(Taking another spoonful)
No undertaste at all. Turn the 
records over.
Guy gets up and goes to the record player. Rosemary doubles 
her napkin in her lap and plops a few spoonful's of the 
mousse into it. She folds the napkin closed and then showily 
scrapes clean the inside of the cup and swallows down the 
scrappings as Guy comes-back to the table.
ROSEMARY
There, Daddy.
(Tilting the cup toward 
him)
Do I get a gold star?
GUY
Two of them. I’m sorry if I was 
stuffy.
ROSEMARY
You were.
GUY
I’m sorry.
He smiles and kisses her.

Rosemary scrapes the uneaten mousse from her napkin into the 
waste bin. The water is running into the sink. We hear the 
sound of television from the other room. A sudden wave of 
dizziness makes her sway for a moment, then blink and frown.
GUY (O.S.)
The Pope at Yankee Stadium. Christ, 
what a mob I
ROSEMARY
Good.
65.
She shakes her head to clear the dizziness, then rolls the 
napkins up inside the tablecloth and puts the bundle aside. 
She turns the water off and loads the dirty dishes into the 
full sink. She dries her hands on the kitchen towel and as 
she hangs it up, another wave of dizziness makes her swivel 
and hang on to the edge of the sink. This time it lasts 
longer.
ROSEMARY
Oh boy!
She straightens up and makes it to the doorway of the Den. 
She keeps her footing with difficulty by holding on to the 
knob with one hand and the jamb with the other.
Guy stands up anxiously.
GUY
What is it?
ROSEMARY
Dizzy.
Guy snaps off the TV, comes to her, takes her arm and holds 
her surely around the waist.
GUY
No wonder, all that booze. You 
probably had an empty stomach, too.
He helps her towards the bedroom but her legs buckle.
He catches her up and carries her. He puts her down on the 
bed and sits beside her, taking her hand and stroking her 
forehead sympathetically. Rosemary closes her eyes.

We will. Tomorrow. There's plenty 
of time.
ROSEMARY
Just a nap.
EXT. DREAM SEQUENCE - (DAY)
55
55
Large Yacht. Rosemary is sitting with a drink in her hand. It 
is sunny and breezy. The Skipper is unrolling a large map to 
plot the course. He is Hutch now and is giving terse and 
knowing instructions to a Negro Mate (Elevator Operator).
Guy’s hands take off the top of Rosemary's pajamas.
ROSEMARY
Why are you taking them off?
INT. BEDROOM - (NIGHT)
56
56
Guy is taking off the top of Rosemary’s pajamas.
GUY
To make you more comfortable.
ROSEMARY
I am comfortable.
GUY
Sleep. Ro.
Guy undoes the snaps at the side and slowly draws off the 
bottom of Rosemary’s pajamas.
EXT/INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - ( ? )
57
57
Back on the yacht. Guy is holding the legs of Rosemary’s 
pajamas and pulling them away from her.
Rosemary tries to hide her nudity? she looks around and sees 
other ladies on the yacht. They are wearing bikinis - so is 
Rosemary. The Skipper is in his Navy uniform.
Hutch is standing on the dock with armloads of weather-
forecasting equipment.
67.
Rosemary comes to the Skipper and asks him very quietly - in 
dream sequences everybody speaks quietly.
ROSEMARY
Isn’t Hutch coming with us?
SKIPPER
Catholics only.
(Smiling)
I wish we weren’t bound by these 
prejudicess, but unfortunately -
(Spreading his arms)
Rosemary turns. There is her family? Ma, Pa, children we have 
seen in the previous dream, several pregnant women.
Guy is taking off Rosemary's wedding ring. She looks 
surprised then she closes her eyes.
ROSEMARY
Sleep.
Set is now a composite of the Sistine Chapel Ceiling with 
Michelangelo frescoes and the linen cupboard at the end of 
the hallway. Rosemary is lying on the special elevator which 
carries her horizontally, making it possible for her to see 
the frescoes from very close. As she passes under the shelf, 
partly covered with gingham contact paper, we can hear voices 
off screen.
GUY (O.S.)
Easy.
DR. S. (O.S.)
You’ve got her too high.
Hutch on the dock. We see him from further off and higher. He 
tries to gesticulate as much as the weather-forecasting 
equipment he is carrying will allow him. He shouts and wind 
blows his words away so we hear them only partially.
HUTCH
Typhoon! Typhoon! It killed fifty-
five people in London and it’s 
heading this way.
Back on the Yacht. The wind is even stronger.
Rosemary looks for the skipper but everybody is gone. The 
dock is infinite and bare. Far away, the NEGRO MATE firmly 
holds the wheel. Rosemary goes to him; she is about to warn 
him when the Negro Mate speaks without looking at her.
NEGRO MATE
68.
You’d better go down below, Miss.
Huge Ballroom. On one side is a burning church (it’s 
sometimes burning with real fire and sometimes only a 
picture). On the other side, a BLACK-BEARDED MAN stands 
glaring at Rosemary. In the centre is a bed. She goes to it 
and lies down. She is immediately surrounded by a dozen naked 
men and women.
Guy is among them. They are elderly, the women grotesque and 
slack-breasted. There is also Mrs. Castevet, Laura-Louise and 
Mr. Castevet in a black mitre and black silk robe. With a 
thin black wand, Mr. Castevet is drawing designs on her body, 
dipping the wand's point in a cup of red held for him by a 
SUN-BROWNED MAN. The point moves back and forth across her 
stomach and down to the insides of her thigh so The NAKED 
PEOPLE are chanting - flat, un­ musical, foreign-tongued 
syllables - and a flute or clarinet accompanies them. Guy’s 
eyes are large and tense. He whispers to Mrs. Castevet.
GUY
She's awake, she sees!
MRS. CASTEVET
She don’t see. As long as she ate 
the mouse she can’t see nor hearo 
She’s like dead. Now sing.
Lady comes into the Ballroom. She wears an exquisite ivory 
satin gown embroidered with pearls. She hurries to Rosemary’s 
side.
LADY
I’m sorry to hear you aren’t 
feeling well.
ROSEMARY
It’s only the mouse-bite.
LADY
You’d better have your legs tied 
down in case of convulsions.
ROSEMARY
Yes, I suppose so. There’s always a 
chance it was rabid.
Rosemary watches with interest as WHITE-SMOCKED INTERNS tie 
her arms and legs to the four bedposts.
LADY
If the music bothers you, let me 
know, and I’ll have it stopped.
69.
ROSEMARY
Oh, no. Please don’t change the 
program on my account.
LADY
Try to sleep.
(Smiling warmly)
We’ll be waiting up on deck.
She withdraws, her satin, gown whispering.
Guy comes and bends over Rosemary. He strokes her with both 
hands - a long relishing stroke that begins at her bound 
wrists, and slides down over her arms, breasts, loins and. 
between her legs. He repeats this stroke several times; his 
hands are rough now and sharp-nailed. Rosemary breathes, 
faster. He slips a hand in under her buttocks and raises 
them. He lies forward upon her, his broad chest crushing her 
breasts. He is wearing a suit of coarse leathery armor. As t 
he is making love to her, she opens her eyes and sees yellow 
furnace-eyes in front of her. Protest wakes in Rosemary’s 
eyes.
ROSEMARY
This is no dream. This is 
happening.
Something covers her face fading into darkness.
The Pope comes in with a suitcase in his hand and a coat over 
his arm.
POPE
They tell me you've been bitten by 
a mouse.
Rosemary speaks sadly trying to hide that she is having an 
orgasm.
ROSEMARY
Yes. That’s why I didn’t come to 
see you.
POPE
That’s all righto We wouldn’t want 
you to jeopardize your health.
ROSEMARY
Am I forgiven, Father?
POPE
Absolutely.
70.
He holds out his hand for her to kiss the ring. Its stone is 
a silver filigree ball. Inside it, ANNA MARIA ALBERGHETTI 
sits-waiting.
INT. BEDROOM - (DAY)- OCTOBER 5, 1965
58
58
Guy and Rosemary in bed. Rosemary is asleep and Guy is 
shaking her shoulder. He is sleep-rumpled, needing a shave.
GUY
Hey, it’s after nine.
Rosemary pushes his hand away and turns over onto her 
stomach, her face deep in the pillow.
ROSEMARY
Five minutes.
Guy yanks her hair.
GUY
No. I’ve got to be at Alan's at 
ten.
ROSEMARY
Eat out.
GUY
The hell I will.
Guy slaps Rosemary’s behind through the blanket. For a moment 
she lies motionless, then suddenly she turns back over and 
raises herself on her arms, looking at Guy.
He is lighting a cigarette. He has his pajamas on. Rosemary 
is nude.
ROSEMARY
What time is it?
GUY
Ten after nine.
Rosemary sits up.
ROSEMARY
What time did I go to sleep?
GUY
You didn’t go to sleep, honey, you 
passed out. From now on you get 
cocktails or wine, not cock­ tails 
and wine.
71.
ROSEMARY
(Rubbing her forehead and 
closing her eyes)
The dreams I had.
She opens her eyes aid sees scratches on her left breast; two 
parallel hairlines of red running down into the nipple. She 
pushes the blanket away and sees more scratches, seven or 
eight going this way and that.
GUY
Don't yell. I already filed them 
down.
He shows short, smooth fingernails.
Rosemary looks at him uncomprehendingly.
ROSEMARY
You mean you - while I was - out?
GUY
I didn’t want to miss Baby Night. 
And a couple of my nails were 
ragged.
Guy nods and grins.
GUY
It was kind of fun in a necrophile 
sort of way.
Rosemary looks away, pulling the blanket back up.
ROSEMARY
I dreamed someone was - raping me. 
I don't know — someone unhuman.
GUY
Thanks a lot.
Rosemary turns further away and swings her legs out on the 
other side of the bed.
GUY
What’s the matter?
Rosemary sits there, not looking around at him.
ROSEMARY
Nothing.
GUY
I didn’t want to miss the night.
72.
ROSEMARY
We could have done it this morning 
or tonight. Last night wasn’t the 
only split second.
GUY
I thought you would have wanted me 
to.
Guy runs a finger up Rosemary's back. She squirms away from 
it.
ROSEMARY
It's supposed to be shared. Oh, I 
guess I'm being silly.
She gets up and goes to the closet for her housecoat.
GUY
I'm sorry I scratched you. I was a 
wee bit loaded myself.

Rosemary, ready to go shopping, with two custard cups in her 
hand, rings the bell.
The door opens and Mrs. Castevet appears.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, hello, dear. Did you like it?
73.
(Taking the cups)
I think I put a little too much 
Cream de Cocoa in it.
ROSEMARY
It was delicious. You'll have to 
give me the recipe.
MRS. CASTEVET
I’d love to. Would you do me a 
teeny favor? Six eggs and a small 
Instant Sanka; I’ll pay you later.
INT. GUY AND ROSEMARY’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - (DAY) -

Rosemary is drinking coffee. Guy is practicing with crutches.
ROSEMARY
Don’t you think we ought to talk 
about it?
GUY
About what?
Rosemary looks at Guy. He seems genuinely unknowing.
ROSEMARY
The way you haven’t been looking at 
me.
GUY
What are you talking about? I've 
been looking at you.
ROSEMARY
No you haven’t.
GUY
I have so. Honey, what is it? 
What’s the matter?
ROSEMARY
Nothing. Never mind.
GUY
No, don't say that. What is it?
ROSEMARY
Nothing.
GUY
74.
Ah, look, honey. I know I’ve been 
preoccupied, with the part and all. 
Well gee whiz, Ro, it’s important, 
you know? It doesn’t mean I don’t 
love you.
He leans across the table and kisses her.
INT. HUTCH’S APARTMENT - (DAY) - OCTOBER 21, 1965
64
64
Hutch is sitting barefoot between two bridge tables, each 
with its typewriter and piles of paper. Rosemary is sitting 
on the sofa.
ROSEMARY
It’s a fascinating part. He’ll 
really be noticed this time. He 
also has an offer for a lead in the 
T.V. series, "Greenwich Village.” 
He’s suddenly very hot.
HUTCH
Now I understand why you’re so 
overjoyed.
Rosemary looks at Hutch and smiles.
ROSEMARY
Well, it’s a difficult period in 
his life — a challenge.
HUTCH
I see.
ROSEMARY
You know how it is with actors - 
they're all a bit self-centered. I 
bet Laurence Olivier is vain and 
self-centered —
Rosemary's voice cracks; determined not to cry, she 
continues:
ROSEMARY
It's a difficult part. He’s got to 
work with crutches and naturally 
he’s preoccupied and — and, well, 
preoccupied.
Rosemary breaks down. Hutch comes over and comforts her.
HUTCH
75.
I've a lot of good advice for you, 
but I’m going to shut up.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HUTCH'S APARTMENT - (DAY)
65

Rosemary and Hutch walking along the street.
HUTCH
I meant to ask you. You had another 
suicide up there at Happy House?
ROSEMARY
Oh, didn't I tell you?
HUTCH
No, you didn't.
ROSEMARY
It was that girl I told you about; 
the drug addict who was 
rehabilitated by this old couple. 
I’m sure I told you that.
HUTCH
They didn’t rehabilitate her very 
successfully, it would seem.
ROSEMARY
We’ve gotten to know them well, 
since. Mr. Castevet’s father was a 
theatrical producer in the old 
days.
HUTCH
Castevet. That’s an odd name. 
French, I suppose?
INT. KITCHEN - (DAY) - OCTOBER 22, 1965
66

Guy is sitting at the table reading the theatre section of 
the Sunday Times. Rosemary is preparing breakfast. As she 
puts the Chemex on the table, her eyes fall on the calendar; 
she stares at it.
GUY
(Without looking up)
It was due on Friday.
ROSEMARY
(Surprised)
It was?
76.
Guy nods.
ROSEMARY
It’ll probably come tonight. Or 
tomorrow.
GUY
You want to bet?
ROSEMARY
Okay.
GUY
You’re going to lose, Ro,
ROSEMARY
Shut up, You’re getting me all 
jumpy. It’s only two days.
INT. DR. HILL’S OFFICE - (DAY) - OCTOBER 28, 1965

Rosemary sitting while DR. HILL is measuring her blood 
pressure. He is very young, medium height, and handsome. He 
speaks slowly and tries to appear older by his serious 
behavior.
ROSEMARY
When will I know?
Dr. Hill takes the instrument off Rosemary’s arm, and puts it 
back into the box.
DR. HILL
I will call you as soon as I have 
the results. I like to do a general 
checkup just to know something 
more.
ROSEMARY
It was Elise Dunstan who 
recommended you to me, Dr. Hill.
DR. HILL
Oh, yes, yes. How is she?
ROSEMARY
Fine. And the boys are great. Did 
you deliver all of them?
DR. HILL
No. Only the last.
The NURSE comes with a syringe and two little bottles.
77.
DR. HILL
Universal and haemoglobin.
NURSE
Yes.
She goes to Rosemary, applies a tourniquet and draws blood 
from her arm.
ROSEMARY
We went to see "The Fantasticks” —
DR. HILL
Oh, did you?

Telephone rings. Rosemary picks it up.
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Mrs. Woodhouse?
ROSEMARY
Dr. Hill?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Congratulations.
ROSEMARY
Really?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Really.
Smiling, Rosemary sits down on the side of the bed.
Pause.
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Are you there?
ROSEMARY
What happens now?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
78.
Very little. You come and see me 
next month. And you get those 
Natalin pills. One a day. I’ll mail 
you forms - for the hospital.
ROSEMARY
When will it be?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Works out to June twenty-eighth.
ROSEMARY
That sounds so far away,
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
It is. Oh, one more thing, Mrs. 
Woodhouse. We would like another 
blood sample.
ROSEMARY
Yes, of course.
(A beat)
What for?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Nurse didn't take enough. So would 
you drop by and see her?
ROSEMARY
But - I’m pregnant, aren't I?
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Oh yes. It’s just for blood sugar 
and so forth. Nothing to be 
concerned about. You’re pregnant, 
don’t worry.
ROSEMARY
All right. I’ll come tomorrow.
DR. HILL
(O.S.)
Good. Don’t forget the pills. 
Goodbye.
ROSEMARY
Goodbye, Dr. Hill.
She puts down the telephone slowly and looks at it for a long 
moment, hand still on the receiver.
79.
ROSEMARY
(Whispering)
Blood sugar?
She stands up briskly and walks out.

Rosemary holds out a quarter in her palm. Guy, who has just 
come in, looks at Rosemary’s outstretched hand, closing the 
door behind him.
GUY
What’s this for?
He catches on, takes Rosemary by the shoulders and kisses 
her.
GUY
Oh, that's great, honey! Just 
great.
ROSEMARY
Father.
GUY
Mother.
Rosemary looks up at him, suddenly serious.
ROSEMARY
Guy, listen. Let’s make this a new 
beginning, okay? A new open­ ness 
and talking-to-each-other. Because 
we haven't been open.
Guy puts his hands on her shoulders, his eyes meeting hers 
earnestly.
GUY
It’s true. I’m so God-damned self-
centered, Ro, That's what the whole 
trouble is. You know I love you 
though, don't you? I do, Ro. I 
swear to God. I’ll be as open as -
ROSEMARY
It's my fault as much as -
80.
GUY
Bull. It's mine. Bear with me, will 
you, Ro? I'll try to do better.
ROSEMARY
Oh, Guy.
Deeply moved, she falls Into his arms. They kiss fervently.
GUY
Fine way for parents to be carrying 
on.
Rosemary laughs, wet-eyed.
GUY
Gee, honey. Do you know what I'd 
love to do?
ROSEMARY
What?
GUY
Tell Minnie and Roman.
(Raising a hand)
I know, I know, it’s supposed to be 
a deep dark secret. But I told them 
we were trying. They were so 
pleased -
ROSEMARY
(Lovingly)
Tell them.
Guy kisses her nose.
GUY
Back in two minutes.
(He hurries out the door)

Rosemary fixes her eyes in front of the mirror. She looks at 
herself.
ROSEMARY
You're pregnant.
(Pause)
Another blood sample?
Through the front door comes Mrs. Castevet in a house­ dress, 
Mr. Castevet carrying a bottle of wine, and Guy behind them 
flushed and smiling.
81.
MRS. CASTEVET
Now that's what I call good news! 
Congrat-u-la-tions!
She bears down on Rosemary, takes her by the shoulders and 
kisses her cheek hard and loud. Mr. Castevet kisses 
Rosemary’s other cheek.
MR. CASTEVET
Our best wishes to you, Rosemary. 
We’re more pleased than we can say. 
We have no champagne on hand, but 
this will do just as nicely.
He shows the bottle of St. Julien. Guy goes into the kitchen.
MRS. CASTEVET
When are you due, dear?
ROSEMARY
June twenty-eighth.
MRS. CASTEVET
It’s going to be so exciting.
Guy comes back with glasses and a corkscrew. Mr. Castevet 
turns with him to the opening of the wine.
Mrs. Castevet takes Rosemary’s elbow and they walk together 
into the Living Room.
MRS. CASTEVET
Listen, dear. Do you have a good 
doctor?
ROSEMARY
A very good one.
MRS. CASTEVET
One of the top obstetricians is a 
dear friend of ours. Abe 
Sapirstein. He delivers all the 
Society babies.
Mr. Castevet and Guy are at the other end of the room, busy 
with the wine.
MR. CASTEVET
Abe Sapirstein? One of the finest 
obstetricians in the country.
GUY
Wasn’t he on 'Open End' a couple of 
years ago?
82.
MR. CASTEVET
That’s right.
GUY
Ro?
ROSEMARY
What about Dr. Hill?
GUY
Don’t worry, I’ll tell him some­ 
thing. You know me,
MRS. CASTEVET
I’m not going to let you go to no 
Dr. Hill that nobody heard of! The 
best is what you’re going to have, 
young lady, where’s the phone?
GUY
In the bedroom.
Mrs. Castevet goes into the Bedroom. Mr. Castevet pours 
glasses of wine.
MR. CASTEVET
He’s a brilliant man. Very 
sensitive.
He gives glasses to Rosemary and Guy,
ROSEMARY
Let’s wait for Minnie.
They stand motionless, each holding a glass, Mr. Castevet 
holding two.
GUY
Sit down, honey.
Rosemary shakes her head. Through the open doors of the 
Living Room and Bedroom, we see Mrs. Castevet sitting on the 
bed, holding the phone.
MRS. CASTEVET
Abe? Minnie. Fine. Listen, a dear 
friend of ours just found out today 
that she’s pregnant. Yes, isn't it? 
I’m in her apartment now. We told 
her you’d be glad to take care of 
her and that you wouldn't charge 
none of your fancy Society prices 
neither.
(Silence)
83.
Wait a minute.
(Raising her voice)
Rosemary? Tomorrow morning at 
eleven?
ROSEMARY
Fine.
MR. CASTEVET
You see?
MRS. CASTEVET
(Into the phone)
Eleven's fine, Abe. Yes. You too. 
No, not at all. Let's hope so. 
Good-bye.
Mrs. Castevet comes back into the Living Room.
MRS. CASTEVET
There you are.
GUY
Thanks a million, Minnie.
ROSEMARY
I don't know how to thank you. Both 
of you.
Mrs. Castevet takes the glass of wine from Mr. Castevet.
MRS. CASTEVET
Just have a fine healthy baby; 
that’s all. Oh, my, I can't wait to 
tell Laura-Louise.
ROSEMARY
Oh, please. Don't tell anyone else. 
Not yet.
MR. CASTEVET
She’s right, there'll be plenty of 
time.
(Raising his glass)
To a fine healthy baby.
GUY
Hear, hear.
They all drink.

Guy and Rosemary are in bed. Guy is asleep on his side, but 
Rosemary's eyes are wide open. She lies on her back with her 
hands folded across her stomach.
ROSEMARY
(Almost inaudible)
Andrew - Andy?
(Silence)
Or Susan.
ROSEMARY
(Calling)
Susan!
She looks quickly at Guy but he doesn’t stir. Behind the 
wall, the Castevets bed creaks. A fire engine screams by. Guy 
shifts and mumbles. Suddenly Rosemary slips out of bed, 
tiptoes to the vanity, takes the good luck charm from the 
Louis Sherry box, frees it from its aluminum-foil wrapping 
and puts the chain over her head.
INT. DR. SAPIRSTEIN’S OFFICE - (DAY) - OCTOBER 31, 1965

Rosemary listens carefully to DR. SAPIRSTEIN, sitting on the 
other side of a desk. He is a tall sunburned man with white 
hair, reassuringly old-fashioned and direct.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Please don’t read books. No 
pregnancy was ever exactly like the 
ones described in the books. And 
don't listen to your friends 
either. No two pregnancies are ever 
alike.
ROSEMARY
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
No, no pills. Minnie Castevet has a 
herbarium. I’m going to have her 
make a daily drink-for you that 
will be fresher, safer and more 
vitamin-rich than any pill on the 
market. Any questions you have, 
call me night or day. Call me, not 
your Aunt Fanny. That’s what I’m 
here for.

MRS. CASTEVET

Rosemary happily takes the glass and looks at it,
ROSEMARY
What's in it?
MRS. CASTEVET
Snips and snails and puppy-dogs’ 
tails.
ROSEMARY
(Laughing)
That’s fine, but what if we want a 
girl?
She lifts the glass and starts drinking.
MRS. CASTEVET
Do you?
ROSEMARY
Would be nice if the first one were 
a boy.
MRS. CASTEVET
Well, there you are.
ROSEMARY
No, really, what’s in it?
MRS. CASTEVET
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs...
ROSEMARY
Tennis root?
MRS. CASTEVET
Some of that, some of some other 
things.

ROSEMARY
I’ve been to Vidal Sassoon,
GUY
You didn’t pay them for that, did 
you?
ROSEMARY
I have a - pain.
GUY
Where?
ROSEMARY
(Putting her hands on her 
middle)
Here.
GUY
Just how?
ROSEMARY
Since Monday. A sharp pain.
GUY
Did you see Dr. Sapirstein?
ROSEMARY
I’m seeing him Wednesday.
GUY
But this is ridiculous! Why didn’t 
you say anything? Why didn’t you 
see Dr. Sapirstein?

I see him Wednesday regular.

DR. SAPIRSTEIN
An entirely natural expansion of

ordinary aspirin.
ROSEMARY
I was afraid it might be an ectopic 
pregnancy.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
(Skeptically)
87.
Ectopic? I thought you weren’t 
going to read books, Rosemary,
ROSEMARY
(Blushing)
It was staring at me in the drug 
store.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
And all it did was worry you. Will 
you go home and throw it away, 
please.
ROSEMARY
I will. Promise.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
The pains will be gone in two days.
(Shaking his head)
Ectopic pregnancy.

INT. HALLWAY - (DAY) - DECEMBER 9, 1965

Hutch stands on the threshold, staring at Rosemary.
88.
HUTCH
My God!
ROSEMARY
It’s Vidal Sassoon and it’s very 
in.
She pats her hair. Hutch steps inside and Rosemary closes the 
door.
HUTCH
What’s wrong with you?
ROSEMARY
Do I look that bad?
With a fixed, bright smile, she takes his coat and hat and 
hangs them away.
HUTCH
Terrible. You aren't on one of 
those 'Zen diets' are you?
ROSEMARY
No.
HUTCH
Then what is it? Have you seen a 
doctor?
ROSEMARY
Oh, I might as well tell you. I'm 
pregnant.
HUTCH
That's ridiculous. Pregnant women 
gain weight, they don't lose it.
ROSEMARY
I don't sleep well. I have stiff 
joints or something, so I have 
pains. Nothing serious.
They enter the Living Room. Hutch sits in the easy chair.
HUTCH
Well, congratulations. You must be 
very happy.
ROSEMARY
I am. We both are.
HUTCH
Who's your obstetrician?
89.
ROSEMARY
Abraham Sapirstein. He's -
HUTCH
He delivered two of my daughter's 
babies.
ROSEMARY
He's one of the best in the city.
HUTCH
When did you see him last?
ROSEMARY
Yesterday.
HUTCH
And?
ROSEMARY
He says it’s fairly common.
HUTCH
How much weight have you lost?
ROSEMARY
Three pounds.
HUTCH
Nonsense! You've lost far more than 
that!
ROSEMARY
(Smiling)
It's perfectly normal to lose a 
little at first. Later on I'll be 
gaining.
Rosemary smiles. Hutch leans back and smiles, too.
HUTCH
Well, we'll assume Dr. Sapirstein 
knows whereof he speaks. He should; 
he charges enough.
ROSEMARY
We’re getting bargain rates; our 
neighbors are close friends of his.
The DOOR BELL RINGS.
HUTCH
(Makes a move to rise)
I'll go.
90.
ROSEMARY
Hurts less when I move around.
She goes out of the room to the front door and opens it. Mr. 
Castevet is standing there, looking slightly winded. Rosemary 
smiles.
ROSEMARY
I was just talking about you.
MR. CASTEVET
Favorably I hope. Do you need 
anything from outside?
ROSEMARY
No, nothing. Thanks so much for 
asking.
Mr. Castevet glances beyond her for a moment, and then 
smiles.
MR. CASTEVET
Is Guy home already?
ROSEMARY
No, he won’t be home till six.
Mr. Castevet stays, waiting with a questioning smile.
ROSEMARY
A friend of ours is here.
The questioning smile stays.
ROSEMARY
Would you like to meet him?
MR. CASTEVET
If I won’t be intruding.
She shows Mr. Castevet in. He passes close to her and she 
notices that his ear is pierced. She follows him to the 
living room archway. Hutch rises and smiles.
ROSEMARY
This is Edward Hutchins.
(To Hutch)
This is Roman Castevet.
(To Mr. Castevet)
I was just telling Hutch that it 
was you and Minnie who sent me to 
Dr. Sapirstein.
91.
The two men shake hands and greet each other. The men seat 
themselves and Rosemary sits by Hutch.
MR. CASTEVET
So Rosemary has told you the good 
news, has she?
HUTCH
Yes, she has. Taking better care of 
Rosemary than her own parents 
would.
MR. CASTEVET
We’re very fond of her, and of Guy, 
too.
He pushes against the arms of his chair and raises himself to 
his feet.
MR. CASTEVET
If you’ll excuse me, I have to go 
now. My wife is waiting for me.
HUTCH
(Rising)
It’s a pleasure to have met you.
MR. CASTEVET
We’ll meet again, I’m sure.
(To Rosemary)
Don’t bother, Rosemary.
INT. KITCHEN - (DAY)
80
80
Rosemary and Hutch are sitting drinking coffee.
ROSEMARY
He’s been everywhere in the world. 
Really everywhere.
HUTCH
Nonsense; nobody has.
ROSEMARY
I’ve just noticed he has pierced 
ears.
HUTCH
Pierced ears and piercing eyes. 
What’s she like?
ROSEMARY
92.
Nosey. Funny. Guy’s gotten very 
close to them. I think they’ve 
become sort of parent-figures for 
him.
HUTCH
And you?
ROSEMARY
I’m not sure. Sometimes they’re too 
friendly and helpful.
We hear the front door open; Guy hurries in. He still has his 
make-up on; his face is orange, his eyes black-lashed and 
large.
GUY
Hey, what a surprise.
He comes over and grabs Hutch’s hand before he can rise.
GUY
How are you, Hutch? Good to see 
you.
He clasps Rosemary’s head in his other hand and bends and 
kisses her cheek and lips.
ROSEMARY
You’re the surprise. What happened?
GUY
Ah, they stopped for a rewrite, the 
dumb bastards. Stay where you are, 
nobody move.
He goes out to the closet.
ROSEMARY
(Calling out)
Would you like some coffee?
GUY (O.S.)
Love some!
Rosemary gets up, pours a cup and refills Hutch's cup and her 
own. Hutch sucks at his pipe, looking thoughtfully before 
him. Guy comes back in with his hinds full of packs of Pall 
Mall. He dumps them on the table.
GUY
Loot.
93.
Guy tears a pack open, jams cigarettes up, and pulls one out. 
He winks at Rosemary as she sits down again.
HUTCH
It seems congratulations are in 
order.
GUY
(lighting up)
It’s wonderful, isn’t it?
HUTCH
When is the baby due?
ROSEMARY
June twenty-eighth.
(To Guy)
Do you know that Dr. Sapirstein 
delivered two of Hutch’s grand­ 
children?
GUY
Really?
HUTCH
I met your neighbor, Roman 
Castevet.
GUY
Oh, did you? Funny old duck, isn’t 
he?
ROSEMARY
Did you ever notice that his ears 
are pierced?
GUY
You’re kidding?
ROSEMARY
No I’m not; I saw.
They drink their coffee.
GUY
It’s a shame we haven’t seen more 
of you lately. With me so busy and 
Ro being the way she is, we really 
haven’t seen anyone.
HUTCH
Perhaps we can have dinner together 
soon.
94.
GUY
Sure.
Hutch rises. Guy goes to get his coat.
HUTCH
Thank you for the coffee, my dear.
In the hallway, they meet Guy who is holding out Hutch’s 
coat.
GUY
It's not mine, it must be yours.
HUTCH
Right you are.
He turns around and puts his arms into the sleeves, Guy 
holding it for him. Hutch feels in his pockets.
HUTCH
Have you thought about names yet? 
Or is it too soon?
ROSEMARY
Andrew or Douglas if it’s a boy. 
Melinda or Sarah if it’s a girl.
GUY
Sarah? What happened to Susan?
Guy gives Hutch his hat. Hutch shows them a fur-lined glove 
and feels in his pockets again.
HUTCH
Is there another one of these 
around?
Rosemary looks round the floor and Guy goes to the closet to 
look down on the floor and up on the shelf.
GUY
I don’t see it, Hutch.
HUTCH
Nuisance. I probably left it at 
City Centre. I’ll stop back there. 
Let’s really have that dinner, 
shall we?
GUY
Definitely.
ROSEMARY
95.
Next week.
They watch him go round the first turn of the hallway.
GUY
(To Rosemary)
That was a nice surprise.
ROSEMARY
Guess what he said.
GUY
What?
ROSEMARY
I look terrible.
GUY
Good old Hutch.
He picks up his coat from the closet and puts it on.
GUY
Spreading cheer wherever he goes.
Rosemary looks at him questioningly. Guy moves to the front 
door.
GUY
Going to get a paper.
He turns back to look at Rosemary, over his shoulder.
GUY
(Opening the door)
He is a professional crape-hanger, 
honey.
ROSEMARY
He isn’t a professional crape­ 
hanger.
GUY
(Going out)
Then he sure is one of the top-
ranking amateurs.
INT. DEN - (NIGHT)

Guy watches television.
INT. BEDROOM - (NIGHT)

96.
Rosemary in bed reading. The telephone rings in the other 
room. We hear Guy answering it and after a moment, he appears 
in the doorway, phone in hand.
GUY
Hutch wants to speak to you.
He puts the phone on the bed and plugs it in.
GUY
I told him you were resting. He 
said it couldn’t wait.
Rosemary picks up the receiver. The television is still 
playing in the other room and we can hardly hear Hutch’s 
voice.
ROSEMARY
Hutch?
HUTCH (OOS.)
Tell me, dear, do you go out at 
all?
ROSEMARY
Well, I haven’t been going out. 
Why?
She looks at Guy who looks back at her, frowning, listening.
HUTCH (O.S.)
Can you meet me tomorrow morning at 
eleven in front of the Time-Life 
Building?
ROSEMARY
Yes, if you want me to. What is it? 
Can’t you tell me now?
HUTCH (O.S.)
I’d rather not. We can have an 
early lunch if you’d like.
ROSEMARY
That would be nice.
HUTCH (O.S.)
Good. Eleven o’clock then.
ROSEMARY
Right. Did you get your glove?
HUTCH (O.S.)
97.
No, they didn’t have it. Good 
night. Rosemary. Sleep well.
ROSEMARY
You too. Good night.
She hangs up.
GUY
What was that?
ROSEMARY
He wants to talk to me.
GUY
What about?
ROSEMARY
He didn’t say.
Guy shakes his head, smiling.
GUY
I think those boys’ adventure 
stories are going to his head. 
Where are you meeting him?
ROSEMARY
In front of the Time-Life Building 
at eleven o’clock.
Guy unplugs the phone and goes out with it to the den; almost 
immediately the Television sound stops, and Guy comes back.
GUY
Isn’t it funny? You’re pregnant and 
I’ve got the yens.
He plugs the phone back in again and puts it on the night 
table.
GUY
I’m going to get an ice cream cone. 
Do you want one?
ROSEMARY
Okay.
GUY
Vanilla?
ROSEMARY
Fine.
98.
Guy goes out. Rosemary leans back against the pillows, 
looking ahead at nothing with her book forgotten in her lap. 
Par away we hear a short ring on a doorbell.
Rosemary tries to listen but she has to fold with a sudden 
pain.
INT. HALLWAY - (DAY) - DECEMBER 10, 1965

Rosemary rings the Castevets doorbell. Mrs. Castevet opens 
the door. She is wearing a housecoat with her hair in 
curlers.
MRS. CASTEVET
Hi.
ROSEMARY
Hi, Minnie. I’m going out this 
morning, so I won’t have the drink 
at eleven.
MRS. CASTEVET
Why, that’s fine, dear. You can 
take it later. Buzz me when you get 
back.
EXT. PARK AVENUE - (DAY)
84

- with its centre line of Christmas trees - Sunny, clear cold 
day. Rosemary walks slowly, carrying her pain inside her. Her 
coat is slightly snug over her stomach.
Rosemary passes Salvation Army Santa Clauses, shaking their 
bells, stores with their Christmas windows. She , reaches the 
Time-Life Building and walks around looking for Hutch. It’s 
five-to-eleven on her wristwatch. She sits down on the low 
wall at the side of the forecourt.
She lifts her face to the sun, and listens to the noises of 
the busy street. With her eyes closed, she speaks to herself.
ROSEMARY
Pain, begone! I will have no more 
of thee!
She laughs ruefully. We hear a racketing noise. She opens her 
eyes and looks up. A helicopter passes over the building.
EXT. THE GLASS DOORS OF THE TIME-LIFE BUILDING - (DAY)
85

99.
Rosemary is standing at the edge of the heavy flow of 
traffic. She looks at the out-coming faces, stretching how 
and then on tiptoes. She sees a man looking like Hutch, goes 
towards him, and realizes her mistake. It is a quarter past 
eleven on the clock.
INT. THE TIME-LIFE BUILDING - (DAY)

Rosemary walks in the lobby. She looks vaguely at the 
Directory on the wall.
INT. TIME-LIFE - (DAY)
87

A stainless steel phone booth. A NEGRO GIRL is in it. She 
finishes soon and comes out with a friendly smile. Rosemary 
slips in and dials. On the first ring, a woman’s voice 
answers.
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
Yes?
ROSEMARY
Is this Edward Hutchins’ apartment?
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
Yes. Who is this, please.
ROSEMARY
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse, I 
had an appointment with Mr. 
Hutchins — is he there?
(Silence)
He Hot
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
He was taken ill this morning.
ROSEMARY
Taken ill?
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
Yes. He’s in a deep coma at St. 
Vincent's Hospital.
ROSEMARY
Oh, that’s awful. I spoke to him 
last night about ten-thirty.
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
I spoke to him at eleven.
ROSEMARY
100.
Who is this?
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
You don’t know me, Rosemary, I am 
Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.
ROSEMARY
What's causing it?
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
They don't know yet. At the moment 
he's totally unresponsive.
ROSEMARY
How awful.
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
I’m going to the hospital now.
ROSEMARY
Is there anything I can do?
GRACE CARDIFF (O.S.)
Not really.
EXT. MADISON AVENUE - (DAY)
88
88
Rosemary walks slowly, looking down at the pavement.
She crosses the street. In voluntarily she stops in front of 
a shop window in which a small creche is spot­ lighted. 
Rosemary smiles tenderly at the scene. She sees suddenly her 
own smiling reflection in the window glass. Her black-circled 
eyes look deeper and her cheeks more skeletal. The smile 
fades on her face.
MRS. CASTEVET (O.S.)
Well, this is what I call the long 
arm of coincidence!
Rosemary turns and sees Mrs. Castevet, smiling, coming 
towards her.
MRS. CASTEVET
I said to myself, ’As long as 
Rosemary's out, I might as well go 
out for a little bit of Christ­ mas 
shopping’, and here you are and 
here I am! Isn’t that some­ thing? 
Why, what’s the matter, dear?
She looks at Rosemary, who is frozen with pain.
101.
MRS. CASTEVET
Do you feel all right?
Rosemary nods, pale, biting her lips.
MRS. CASTEVET
You poor thing. You know what I 
think? I think we ought to be going 
home now. What do you say?
ROSEMARY
(Fast)
No, no you have to do your 
shopping.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh shoot, there’s two more weeks.
She puts her wrist to her mouth and blows a whistle on her 
gold-chain bracelet. A taxi veers towards them. They get in.

Rosemary opens fridge, takes out a little piece of meat, goes 
to the stove, puts it on a frying pan for two seconds each 
side, then puts it on a plate, sits down at the table and 
starts cutting the practically raw meat. There are many 
Christmas cards piled on the table. Rosemary, while eating, 
writes names on the cards.

New Year’s Eve party. All elderly people talking quietly, 
drinks in their hands. LAURA-LOUISE, MR. & MRS. FOUNTAIN, MR. 
& MRS. GILMORE, MR. & MRS. WEES, MRS. SABATINI and her cat. 
In two armchairs sit DR. SAPIRSTEIN and ROSEMARY. GUY is at 
her side, resting on the arm of her chair.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
It’ll stop any day now.
ROSEMARY
It’s like a wire inside me getting 
tighter and tighter.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Usually older women, with less 
flexible joints have this sort of 
trouble.
102.
ROSEMARY
I’m not going out any more.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
You don’t have to —
Mrs. Castevet brings DR. SHAND towards them.
MRS. CASTEVET
Rosemary, I’d like you to meet Dr. 
Shand. He used to be a famous 
dentist? and he made the chain for 
your charm.
ROSEMARY
Nice to meet you.
MR. CASTEVET
(Holding up a bottle of 
champagne)
One minute to go!
Guy looks at his watch, stands up and goes toward Mr. 
Castevet. Mr. Castevet opens the champagne. He is an 
attentive and energetic host. Mrs. Castevet and Guy help with 
glasses. The champagne is passed around.
MR. CASTEVET
(Raising his glass)
To 1966, The Year One!
INT. KITCHEN - (EARLY MORNING) - JANUARY 12, 1966

Rosemary in front of the open fridge chewing a raw and 
dripping chicken heart. She catches her reflection in the 
side of the toaster, looks at herself, her hand and the part 
of the heart not yet eaten held in red-dripping fingers. She 
goes over and puts the heart in the garbage, then turns on 
the water and rinses her hand. With the water still running, 
she bends over the sink and begins to vomit. She drinks some 
water, washes her face and hands, turns off the water and 
dries her­ self. She stands for a while, thinking; she gets a 
memo pad and pencil from a drawer, sits at the table and 
starts to write.
INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - (DAY)
92

Guy, in his pajamas, goes across the hallway. He enters the 
kitchen. Rosemary his the Life Cookbook open on the table and 
is copying a recipe from it.
GUY
103.
What the hell are you doing?
ROSEMARY
Planning the menu. We’re giving a 
party on January twenty-second. A 
week from next Saturday.
She looks among several slips of paper on the table and picks 
one up.
ROSEMARY
For our old friends. I mean our 
young friends. Minnie and Roman are 
not invited. Neither is Laura-
Louise. Neither is Dr. Sapirstein 
and Dr. Shand. This is a very 
special party. You have to be under 
sixty to get in.
GUY
Whew! For a minute there I didn’t 
think I was going to make it.
ROSEMARY
Oh, you make it. You’re the 
bartender.
GUY
Swell. Do you really think this is 
such a great idea?
ROSEMARY
I think it’s the best idea I’ve had 
in months.
GUY
Don’t you think you ought to check 
with Sapirstein first?
ROSEMARY
Why? I’m just going to give a 
party? I’m not going to swim the 
English Channel.
Guy goes to the sink, turns on the water and holds a glass 
under it. He turns off the water, raises the glass and 
drinks.
GUY
What about the pain?
ROSEMARY
(Smiling drily;)
104.
Haven’t you heard? It’ll go in a 
day or two.
INT. KITCHEN - (DAY) - JANUARY 17, 1966

Mrs. Castevet is standing beside Rosemary in the doorway. 
Rosemary is wearing an apron and holding the glass with the 
drink in her hand. On the table, there is crab-meat and 
pieces of lobster and other food9 ready to be cooked. Mrs. 
Castevet looks at the preparations.
MRS. CASTEVET
That looks interesting. What is it?
ROSEMARY
We’re having some people over, on 
Saturday.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh, you feel up to entertaining?
ROSEMARY
Yes, I do. These are old friends 
whom we haven’t seen in a long 
time. They don’t even know yet that 
I’m pregnant.
MRS. CASTEVET
I’d be glad to give you a hand if 
you’d like. I could help you dish 
things out.
ROSEMARY
That’s sweet of you, but I can 
manage. It’s going to be a buffet 
and we are getting a bartender.
MRS. CASTEVET
I could help you take the coats.
ROSEMARY
No, really, Minnie, you do enough 
for me as it is. Really.
MRS. CASTEVET
Well, let me know if you change 
your mind. Drink your drink now.
Rosemary looks at the glass in her hand.
ROSEMARY
I’d rather not.
105.
(Looking at Mrs. 
Castevet)
Not this minute. I’ll drink it in a 
little while.
MRS. CASTEVET
It doesn’t do to let it stand.
ROSEMARY
I won’t wait long. Go on,, You go 
back and I’ll bring the glass to 
you later on.
MRS. CASTEVET
I’ll wait and save you the walk.
ROSEMARY
You’ll do no such thing. I get very 
nervous if anyone watches me while 
I’m cooking. Scoot now, go on. 
You’re too nice to me, really you 
are.
Mrs. Castevet backs away.
MRS. CASTEVET
Don’t wait too long. It’s going to 
lose its vitamins.
Mrs. Castevet goes. Rosemary watches the door close.
She goes into the kitchen and stands a moment with the glass 
in her hand, then goes to the sink and tips out the pale 
green drink straight down into the drain.
INT. GUY AND ROSEMARY’S APARTMENT - PARTY - (NIGHT) - JANUARY

There is a fire going and an Italian bartender, RENATO, mixes 
drinks quickly. People already there are? TED and CAROLE 
WENDELL, JOAN JELICO, ELISE and HUGH (limp­ing) DUNSTAN, RAIN 
MORGAN (a beautiful Negro nodel), JIMMY and TIGER, LOU and 
CLAUDIA COMFORT and SCOTT (Claudia’s brother). JOAN is giving 
Rosemary a hug and a kiss.
JOAN
You dirty stinking secret-keeper!
RAIN MORGAN (O.S.)
Who's pregnant?
ELISE (O.S.)
Rosemary is.
106.
People gather to congratulate Rosemary. Telephone RINGS in 
the bedroom. Claudia SHOUTS:
CLAUDIA (O.S.)
Rosie! Bob and Lee are stuck at 
another party. They’ll be right 
over.
RAIN MORGAN
Congratulations.
Lou and Claudia come from the bedroom.
CLAUDIA
You’re so lucky. What a great 
house?
HUGH DUNSTAN
Adrian Marcato lived here
GUY
And the Trench sisters.
The DOORBELL RINGS; Rosemary goes out.
JIMMY
The Trent sisters?
HUGH DUNSTAN
Trench. They ate little children.,
TED
And he doesn’t mean just ate them. 
He means ate them?
Rosemary opens the door. Mike and Pedro stand there with 
bouquets of bright red roses. They kiss, Pedro, with his 
cheek against Rosemary, murmurs?
PEDRO
Make him feed you, baby; you look 
like a bottle of iodine,
Rosemary takes the roses into the kitchen, Elise Dunstan 
comes in after her, with a drink in her hand,
ELISE DUNSTAN
Will you look at this kitchen? Are 
you all right, Rosie? You look a 
little tired.
ROSEMARY
Thanks for the understatement,
107.
ELISE
How do you like C. C. Hill? Isn't 
he a dreamboy?
ROSEMARY
Yes, but I’m not using him.
ELISE
No!
ROSEMARY
I’ve got a doctor named Sapirstein, 
an older man.
Guy looks in.
ELISE
Well congratulations, Dad.
GUY
Thanks. Weren't nothin’ to it. Do 
you want me to bring in the dip, 
Ro?
ROSEMARY
Oh, yes, would you? Look at these 
roses!
Guy takes a tray of crackers and a bowl of pale pink dip from 
the table.
GUY
(To Elise)
Would you get the other one?
ELISE
Sure.
Elise takes the second bowl and follows Guy out.
PORTIA HAYNES and DEE BERTILLON arrive. They leave their 
coats in the bedroom.
In the living room, Guy puts dip on table.
TIGER
Hey, what ever happened to the 
other guy? Is he still blind?
GUY
I don’t know.
108.
Rosemary enters with roses. Mike wig-wags over heads and 
mouths "Congratulations." Rosemary smiles and mouths 
"Thanks."
CAROL
Donald Baumgart? You know who he 
is, Tiger, he’s the boy Zoe Piper 
lives with.
TIGER
Oh, is he the one?
Renato gives Rosemary a scotch with a lot of water.
RENATO
I make the first ones strong, to 
get them happy. Then I go light and 
conserve.
CAROL
He’s writing a great play.
ROSEMARY
Is he still blind?
CAROL
Oh, yes. He’s going through hell 
trying to make the adjustment. But 
this great play is coming out of 
it. He dicates and Zoe writes.
Rosemary shuts her eyes and holds her breath with pain.
She puts her drink aside.
CLAUDIA
Are you all right?
ROSEMARY
(Smiling)
Yes, fine. I had a cramp for a 
moment.
INT. KITCHEN - (NIGHT)

Tiger watches Rosemary tossing the salad. Joan and Elise come 
in and close the door behind them.
JOAN
Is the doctor satisfied with your 
condition?
Rosemary nods.
109.
JOAN
Claudia said you had a cramp.
ROSEMARY
I have a pain. But it's going to 
stop soon.
TIGER
What kind of a pain?
ROSEMARY
A - a pain. A sharp pain, that’s 
all. It’s because my pelvis is 
expanding.
ELISE
Rosie, I’ve had that - two times. 
It’s a bit like a Charley horse, 
that's all.
ROSEMARY
Well, everyone is different. Every 
pregnancy is different.
JOAN
Not that different. You look like 
Miss Concentration Camp ’66. Are 
you sure this doctor knows what 
he’s doing?
Rosemary begins to sob quietly and defeatedly, holding the 
wooden spoon in the salad. Tears run down her cheeks.
JOAN
Oh, God.
She looks for help to Tiger who touches Rosemary’s shoulder.
TIGER
Shh, ah, shh, don’t cry, Rosemary.
ELISE
It's good. It's the best thing. Let 
her.
Rosemary weeps, black streaks smearing down her cheeks.
Elise puts her into a chair; Tiger takes the spoons from her 
hands and moves the salad bowl to the far side of the table. 
The door starts to open and Joan runs to it and stops and 
blocks it. It’s Guy.
GUY (O.S.)
Hey, let me in.
110.
JOAN
Sorry. Girls only.
GUY (O.S.)
Let me speak to Rosemary.
JOAN
Can't; she' s busy.
GUY (O.S.)
Look, I've got to wash glasses.
JOAN
Use the bathroom.
She shoulders the door; it closes with a click and she leans 
against it.
GUY (O.S.)
Damn it, open the door.
Rosemary goes on crying, her head bowed, her shoulders 
heaving, her hands limp in her lap. Elise crouches, wiping at 
her cheeks with the end of a towel; Tiger smooths her hair 
and tries to still her shoulders.
ROSEMARY
It hurts so much.
She raises her face to them.
ROSEMARY
I’m so afraid the baby is going to 
die.
ELISE
What is he doing to help you?
ROSEMARY
Nothing, nothing.
TIGER
When did it start?
Rosemary SOBS.
ELISE
When did the pain start, Rosie?
ROSEMARY
In November.
ELISE
In November?
111.
JOAN
(From the door)
What?
TIGER
You've been in pain since November, 
and he isn't doing anything for 
you?
ROSEMARY
He says it'll stop.
JOAN
Why don’t you see another doctor?
Rosemary shakes her head.
ROSEMARY
He’s very good. He was on "Open 
End."
TIGER
He sounds like a sadistic nut.
ELISE
Pain like that is a warning that 
something’s not right. Go see Dr. 
Hill, Rosie. See somebody besides 
that -
TIGER
That nut.
ELISE
You can’t go on suffering like 
this.
ROSEMARY
I won’t have an abortion.
Joan leans from the door whispering.
JOAN
Nobody’s telling you to have an 
abortion! Just go see another 
doctor, that’s all.
Rosemary takes the towel and presses it to each eye in turn. 
She smiles at Elise, and at Tiger and Joan.

The guests are sitting round in various places with napkins 
and plates on their knees, eating chute and salad. Renato is 
serving wine.
CLAUDIA’S BROTHER
His name is Altizer and he’s down 
in - Atlanta, I think; he says that 
the death of God is a specific 
historic event that happened right 
now, in our time. That God 
literally died.
JIMMY
Hey, snow!
Guests crowd the windows; fat wet snowflakes shear down, now 
and then striking one of the panes, sliding and melting.
ROSEMARY
This is why I wanted this 
apartment; to sit here and watch 
the snow with the fire going.

There are dirty glasses, used napkins and spilling-over 
ashtrays all round. Rosemary is sitting. Guy is stand­ing with 
his hands on his hips; looking round the room.
GUY
The thing to do now is move.
ROSEMARY
Guy.
GUY
Yes?
ROSEMARY
I’m going to Dr. Hill. Monday 
morning.
Guy says nothing, looking at Rosemary.
ROSEMARY
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying or 
else he’s - I don’t know, out of 
his mind. Pain like this is a 
warning that something is wrong.
GUY
Rosemary.
113.
ROSEMARY
And I’m not drinking Minnie’s drink 
any more. I want vitamins in pills, 
like everybody else. I haven’t 
drunk it for three days now. I’ve 
thrown it away.
GUY
You’ve -
ROSEMARY
I’ve made my own drink instead.
Guy draws together all his surprise and anger and points back 
over his shoulder toward the kitchen, crying at her.
GUY
Is that what those bitches were 
giving you in there? Is that their 
hint for today?
ROSEMARY
They’re my friends. Don't call 
them, bitches.
GUY
They're a bunch of not-very-bright 
bitches who ought to mind their own 
God-damned business.
ROSEMARY
All they said was get a second 
opinion.
GUY
You've got the best doctor in New 
York, Rosemary. Do you know what 
Dr. Hill is? Charley Nobody, that's 
what he is.
ROSEMARY
I'm tired of hearing how great Dr. 
Sapirstein is.
(She starts to cry)
GUY
We'll have to pay Sapirstein and 
pay Hill too. It's out of the 
question.
ROSEMARY
I'm not going to change, I'm just 
going to let Hill examine me and 
give his opinion.
114.
GUY
I won't let you. It's - it's not 
fair to Sapirstein.
Rosemary rises.
ROSEMARY
Not fair to - What are you talking 
about? What about what's fair to 
me?
GUY
You want another opinion? All 
right. Tell Sapirstein; let him 
decide who gives it. At least have 
that much courtesy to the top man 
in his field.
ROSEMARY
I want Dr. Hill. If you won't pay 
I'll
She stops short and stands motionless, paralyzed, no part of 
her moving. A tear slides down her cheek.
GUY
Ro?
Rosemary catches her breath.
GUY
Ro?
He takes a step forward, worried.
ROSEMARY
It stopped.
GUY
What?
ROSEMARY
The pain.
GUY
Stopped?
ROSEMARY
Just now.
She manages to smile at him.
ROSEMARY
It stopped. Just like that.
115.
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath; then another 
one, deeper still. She opens her eyes. Guy is still looking 
at her, worried.
GUY
What was in the drink you made?
Consternation. Rosemary doesn't answer immediately.
ROSEMARY
An egg. Milk. Sugar.
GUY
What else?
Rosemary puts her hands on her stomach, concentrating.
GUY
What else?
Rosemary giggles.
GUY
Rosemary, for Christ's sake, what 
was in the drink?
ROSEMARY
It's alive.
(She giggles again)
It’s moving. It's all right. It's 
moving.
She looks down at her stomach and presses it lightly.
She reaches for Guy, not looking at him; snaps her fingers 
quickly for his hand. He comes closer and gives it. She puts 
it to the side of her stomach and holds it.
ROSEMARY
You feel it?
(She looks at him)
There.
Guy jerks his hand away, pale.
GUY
Yes. Yes, I felt it.
ROSEMARY
(Laughing)
It's nothing to be afraid of. It 
won't bite you
GUY
116.
It's wonderful.
Rosemary holds her stomach again, looking down at it.
ROSEMARY
It's alive. It’s kicking.
Rosemary laughs and cries too, holding her stomach with both 
hands.
GUY
I’ll clean up some of this mess.
He picks up an ashtray and a glass and another glass.

The grumbling PAPERHANGER sticks yellow and white paper on

cake.
TWO WORKERS come with a bureau, Guy with a bathinette, and 
Rosemary with a crib. She is much bigger than before. She 
looks healthier and prettier.
Rosemary puts baby clothes into the bureau; receiving 
blankets, waterproof pants and shirts. She holds up a tiny 
shirt to show Guy. They both laugh.

An open suitcase lying on the bed. Rosemary in her ninth 
month is putting things into it (nightgowns, nursing 
brassieres, a quilted housecoat, etc.). She closes the 
suitcase, goes to the Hallway and leaves it next to the 
Bedroom door.
In the Living Room, Guy is sitting in an armchair with an 
open newspaper. He watches Rosemary as she places the 
suitcase.
GUY
What’s that for?
ROSEMARY
My hospital suitcase.
GUY
Honey, you have three weeks to —

The telephone rings. Rosemary goes to answer it. Guy strains 
to listen.
ROSEMARY (O.S.)
Yes. Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.
(Beat)
No!
(Beat)
Oh my God!
(Long silence)
Oh my God! Yes I will.
Guy stands up and goes toward the Bedroom. As he is under the 
archway, Rosemary appears in the Bedroom door. They look at 
each other for a moment.
ROSEMARY
Hutch is dead.
Guy turns white. There is a long silence.
ROSEMARY
I feel awful. All this time I 
didn’t even think of him.

Rosemary gets out of a taxi. She is late; the funeral guests 
are leaving the cemetery and getting into cars.
Rosemary meets DORIS and her HUSBAND.
ROSEMARY
I’m Mrs. Woodhouse. I knew your 
father.
DORIS
Oh, you’re Rosemary?
They shake hands.
ROSEMARY
Yes. I know how you feel, both of 
you.
Doris indicates EDNA, who looks like Doris, but a little 
younger.
DORIS
This is my sister, Edna.
Rosemary shakes Edna’s hand.
118.
ROSEMARY
Nice to meet you. I’m so sorry to 
be late.
GRACE CARDIFF, a smartly dressed woman in her early fifties, 
touches Rosemary’s arm.
GRACE CARDIFF
Excuse me.
ROSEMARY
Yes?
GRACE CARDIFF
I’m Grace Cardiff.
ROSEMARY
Oh! I’m glad I met you. Thank you 
so much for calling me.
Grace Cardiff is holding a book-size brown-paper package.
GRACE CARDIFF
I was going to mail this. Then I 
thought you’d be here.
She gives Rosemary the package. Rosemary looks at it; her 
name and address are printed on it, and Grace Cardiff’s 
return address.
ROSEMARY
What is it
GRACE CARDIFF
Hatch regained consciousness at the 
end and ho thought it was the next 
morning. You know - when you had 
the appointment.
ROSEMARY
Yes.
GRACE CARDIFF
I wasn’t there, but he told the 
doctor to make sure that you got 
the book that was on his desk.
Grace gets into car. The car begins to leave.
ROSEMARY
Thank you.
GRACE CARDIFF
(Through window)
119.
Oh, and I’m to tell you, the name 
is an anagram.
ROSEMARY
The name of the book?
GRACE CARDIFF
Apparently. He was delirious - so 
it’s hard to be sure.

Rosemary slips out of her shoes, takes off her gloves and 
pushes her feet into slippers. At the same time, she picks up 
her handbag, opens it and takes out the wrapped book. The 
doorbell rings. Still carrying the book, Rosemary goes to 
open the door. Mrs. Castevet stands there with the drink and 
a little white cake.
MRS. CASTEVET
I heard you come in. It certainly 
wasn’t very long.
ROSEMARY
I was late. Couldn’t get a taxi.
She takes the glass and drinks the pale green liquid.
MRS. CASTEVET
Oh! What a shame! You got mail 
already?
ROSEMARY
No, someone gave it to me.
MRS. CASTEVET
Here, I’ll hold it.
Mrs. Castevet takes the package and hands Rosemary the white 
cake. Rosemary starts to eat it.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Weighing the package)
A book?
ROSEMARY
Mm-hmm.
MRS. CASTEVET
(Reading the return 
address)
Oh, I know that house. The Gilmores 
used to live there.
120.
ROSEMARY
Oh?
MRS. CASTEVET
I’ve been there lots of times. 
’Grace'. That’s one of my favorite 
names.
ROSEMARY
Yes?
She finishes the cake and the drink and takes the package 
from Mrs. Castevet; giving her the glass.
MRS. CASTEVET
You need anything?
ROSEMARY
No, thanks.
MRS. CASTEVET
Take a nap, why don’t you?
ROSEMARY
I’m going to. ’By.
With a paring knife Rosemary cuts the string of the package 
and undoes the brown paper. It is a black book, not new; the 
gold lettering, all worn away, says: "All Of Them Witches by 
J.R. Hanslet.” On the flyleaf is HUTCH’S signature, with the 
inscription: "Torquay, 1934.” Rosemary goes into the living 
room, riffling its pages. There are occasional photographs of 
respectable-looking Victorians, several underlining's and 
marginal checkmarks. One underlined phrase is: "the fungus 
they call 'Devil's Pepper’." Rosemary sits in one of the 
window bays and looks at the table of contents. The name: 
"Adrian Marcato" is the title of Chapter Four. Other chapter 
titles: "Prudence Duvernoy: Stanley Rolfe; Aleister Crowley; 
Margaret Wick; Witch Practices; Witchcraft and Satanism."
Rosemary turns back to the chapter: Adrian Marcato. "Born in 
Glasgow in 18^6, he was brought soon after to New York 
(underlined)...he was attacked by a mob out­ side the 
Bramford...."
ROSEMARY
Outside. Not in the lobby.
There is a standing portrait of Marcato, a hypnotic­ eyed 
black-bearded man. Rosemary turns the page.
121.
There is a less formal photograph of him sitting at a Paris 
café. The caption reads: "Paris, 1899. Adrian Marcato, his 
wife and son, Steven." The name "Steven" is underlined. 
Rosemary flips through the book; pauses for other 
underlining. A few pages later: "the universally-held belief 
in the power of fresh blood."
Rosemary looks up from the book, and whispers:
ROSEMARY
But there are no witches. Not 
really.
She closes the book, looks at the title.
ROSEMARY
’The name is an anagram.’
Holding the book on her lap, she looks at the ceiling; then 
at the book again. Suddenly, she stands up and goes to get 
the Scrabble Set. She puts the book, an open board and the 
box on the floor. Kneeling in front of them, she picks up the 
letters to spell: "All Of Them Witches". She jumbles the 
letters, mixes them round and starts building a new sentence; 
it comes out: "Comes with the fall". Then: "How is hell fact 
me". She looks at the one letter left in her hand for a 
moment. Then, mixes the letters again and forms: "Elf shot 
lame witch" and "Tell me which fatso".
ROSEMARY
That really makes sense.
She puts the letters back in the box, the box on the board, 
the book on top of the box, and everything on the window 
seat. She steps back and looks at them.
ROSEMARY
Poor Hutch.
A new idea comes. Slowly, she picks up the book, looks at the 
edge, finds the place where the corner of a page had been 
folded. She bends the corner again as it was, then 
straightens it. Once more, she looks at the Paris photograph 
and the name "Steven" under­ lined. Suddenly, she grabs the 
box and empties it on the floor. Very fast, she forms the 
name "Steven Marcato" with the wooden squares; Index finger, 
"R” out, then "O". With two fingers "M" and "A". With index, 
"N": "ROMAN". With her whole hand, she moves "STEVE" to the 
right, after "ROMAN". Again her index finger pulls down "T" 
at the end of it and "GA" in front: "ROMAN CASTEVET".

The front door unlocks and pushes against the chain.
Rosemary is sitting in the kitchen eating tuna fish; the open 
book in front of her. She lifts her head, listening. The 
doorbell rings and Rosemary goes to see who it is. It’s Guy. 
She lets him in. He has a bunch of daisies and a box from 
Bronzini.
GUY
What’s with the chain?
Rosemary closes the door and rechains it.
GUY
What’s the matter?
He kisses her and gives her the daisies.
GUY
Are you all right?
ROSEMARY
Yes.
She goes into the kitchen.
GUY
How was the funeral?
(Going towards the 
bedroom)
ROSEMARY
O.K.
Rosemary puts the daisies into a blue pitcher. Guy calls out 
from the Bedroom.
GUY (O.S.)
I got the shirt that was in "The 
New Yorker”.
Rosemary takes the flowers into the living room.
Guy comes in and shows her the shirt.
ROSEMARY
That's nice. Do you know who Roman 
really is?
Guy looks at her, blinks and frowns.
GUY
What do you mean, honey?
123.
ROSEMARY
He's Adrian Marcato's son.
GUY
What?
ROSEMARY
I’ll show you something.
(Going towards the 
kitchen)
'Roman Castevet' is 'Steven 
Marcato’ rearranged.
They enter the kitchen. Rosemary picks up the book and gives 
it to Guy.
ROSEMARY
It's from Hutch.
Guy looks at the book, then puts his shirt aside, and starts 
leafing through it. Rosemary puts her finger on the Parisian 
photograph.
ROSEMARY
Here he is when he was thirteen. 
See the eyes?
GUY
A coincidence.
ROSEMARY
In the same house? And look here -
She turns the page and searches for a second, Guy still 
holding the book.
ROSEMARY
"Soon after that, in August 1886, 
his son Steven was born". 1886. Got 
it? Makes him seventy-nine now. No 
coincidence.
GUY
No, I guess not.
(Springing through the 
pages)
He’s Steven Marcato, all right. 
Poor old geezer. With a crazy 
father like that no wonder he 
switched his name around.
Rosemary looks at Guy uncertainly.
ROSEMARY
124.
You don’t think he’s - the same?
GUY
(Smiling)
What do you mean? A witch?
Rosemary nods.
GUY
Ro, are you kidding?
He laughs and gives the book back to her.
GUY
Ah Ro, honey.
He picks up his shirt and goes to the Living Room.
ROSEMARY
His father was a martyr to it. Do 
you know how he died?
GUY
Honey, it’s 1966.
Rosemary holds out the book towards him.
ROSEMARY
This was published in 1933; there 
were covens in Europe - that’s what 
they’re called, the the - 
congregation; covens - in Europe, 
in America, in Australia. They’ve 
got one right here — all that 
bunch; those parties with the flute 
and the chanting, those are 
sabbaths or esbats or whatever-
they-are!
GUY
Honey, don’t get excited! Let's -
ROSEMARY
Read what they do, Guy.
She opens the book at him and jabs a page with her 
forefinger.
ROSEMARY
They use blood in their rituals, 
and the blood that has the most 
power is a baby’s blood. And they 
use more than the blood, they use 
the flesh too.
125.
GUY
For God's sake, Rosemary!
ROSEMARY
They’re not setting foot in this 
apartment ever again. And they’re 
not coming within fifty feet of the 
baby.
GUY
Honey, they’re old people and they 
have a bunch of old friends, and 
Dr. Shand happens to play the 
recorder.
She goes to the window where the Scrabble set lay, holding 
the book in both hands, trembling.
ROSEMARY
I’m not going to take any chances 
with the baby's safety. We’re going 
to sub-let and move out.
GUY
We are not.
ROSEMARY
(Turning to him)
Oh yes we are.
Guy picks up his new shirt and goes out and into the Bedroom.
GUY
We’ll talk about it later.
Rosemary sits down next to the Scrabble set. She closes it 
and, after a moment, opens the book and begins to read the 
final chapter; "Witchcraft and Satanism". Guy comes back in 
without the shirt.
GUY
I don’t' think you ought to read 
any more of that.
ROSEMARY
Just this last chapter.
GUY
Not today, honey.
He puts his hand out and waits for her to give him the book.
GUY
126.
You’re shaking. Come on, give it to 
me. You’ll read it tomorrow.
ROSEMARY
Guy -
GUY
No, I mean it. Come on, give it to 
me.
ROSEMARY
Ohh.
She gives it to him. He goes over to the bookshelves, 
stretches up, and puts it as high as he can reach, across the 
tops of the two Kinsey Reports.

Fantastic, Absolutely fantastic. 
What did you say the name was, 
’Machado'?
ROSEMARY
Marcato.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Fantastic. I think he told me once 
that his father was a coffee 
importer.
ROSEMARY
Re told Guy that he was a producer.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
(Shaking his head)
I understand how disturbed you must 
be to have him for a close 
neighbor.
ROSEMARY
I don’t want anything more to do 
with him or Minnie. I don’t want to 
take even the slightest chance 
where the baby’s safety is 
concerned.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
127.
Absolutely. Any mother would feel 
the same way.
ROSEMARY
(Leaning forward)
Is there any chance at all that 
Minnie put something harmful in the 
drink or in those little cakes?
Dr. Sapirstein laughs.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
No, Rosemary. I would have seen 
evidence of it long ago.
ROSEMARY
I won’t take anything else from 
her.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
You won’t have to. I can give you 
some pills that will be adequate in 
these last few weeks. In a way this 
may be the answer to Minnie and 
Roman’s problem too.
ROSEMARY
What do you mean?
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Roman is very ill. In fact - 
confidentially - he has no more 
than a month or two left to him.
ROSEMARY
I had no idea--
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
He wanted to pay a last visit to a 
few of his favorite cities, but 
they didn’t want to offend you by 
leaving before the baby's birth.
ROSEMARY
I’m sorry to hear that Roman isn’t 
well.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
He would be extremely embarrassed 
if he knew what you found out. 
Suppose we do this: I’ll tell them 
to leave on Sunday. I’ll say I 
spoke to you, and you understand.
128.
ROSEMARY
Are you sure they’ll leave on 
Sunday?
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
I’ll see to it.

All right. I’ll go along, but only 
until Sunday.

the transistor radio over his shoulder, Mrs. Castevet in 
white dress and gloves, with a camera and a hatbox, Rosemary 
in her peppermint-striped smock, and Guy in blue jeans and a 
T-shirt. Two big suitcases are beside them on the sidewalk.
MRS. CASTEVET
No matter where we are, our 
thoughts are going to be with you 
every minute, darling, till you’re 
all happy and thin again with your 
sweet little boy or girl lying safe 
in your arms.
Rosemary kisses her cheek.
ROSEMARY
Thank you. Thank you for 
everything.
MRS. CASTEVET
You make Guy send us lots of 
pictures, you hear?
ROSEMARY
I will. I will.
Mrs. Castevet turns to Guy and Mr. Castevet takes Rosemary's 
hand.
MR. CASTEVET
I won’t wish you luck, because you 
won't need it. You're going to have 
a happy, happy life.
Rosemary kisses him.
ROSEMARY
129.
Have a wonderful trip, and come 
back safely.
MR. CASTEVET
(Smiling)
Perhaps. But I may stay on in 
Dubrovnik, or Pescara or maybe 
Mallorca. We shall see, we shall 
see...
ROSEMARY
(Meaning it)
Come back.
She kisses him again.
A taxi comes. Guy and the Doorman stow the suitcases beside 
the DRIVER. Mrs. Castevet shoulders and grunts her way in, 
sweating under the arms of her white dress, Mr. Castevet 
folds himself in beside her.
MR. CASTEVET

As the taxi pulls away there are more ’Goodbyes' through the

speeding away with hands ungloved and white-gloved waving 
from either side of it.

"Spells can’t be cast without one of the victim’s 
belongings."
She stands up and starts walking around the room. She lifts 
the front of her dress and sniffs it.

Rosemary changes her dress, splashes herself all over with 
cologne.
ROSEMARY ON THE PHONE - (DAY)
113
113
The ringing tone before someone answers.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
Yeh?
ROSEMARY
133.
Is this Donald Baumgart?
BAUMGART (O.S.)
That’s right.
ROSEMARY
This is Rosemary Woodhouse. Guy 
Woodhouse’s wife.
BAUMGART (O.S.)
Oh?
ROSEMARY
I wanted -
BAUMGART (O.S.)
My God, you must be a happy little 
lady these days! Living in the 
Bram. Rows of uniformed lackeys -
ROSEMARY
I wanted to know now you are; if 
there’s been any improvement.
BAUMGART (O.S.)
(Laughing)
Why bless your heart, Guy 
Woodhouse’s wife. I’m splendid! I 
only broke six glasses today.
ROSEMARY
Guy and I are both very unhappy 
that he got his break because of 
your misfortune.
Silence for a moment.
BAUMGART (O.S.)
Oh, what the hell. That’s the way 
it goes.
ROSEMARY
I’m sorry I didn’t come along that 
day he came to visit you.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
Visit me? You mean the day we met 
for drinks?
ROSEMARY
Yes. That’s what I meant.
(Voice shaking)
By the way, he has something of 
yours, you know.
134.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
What do you mean?
ROSEMARY
Don't you know?
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
No.
ROSEMARY
Didn’t you miss anything that day?
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
You don’t mean my tie, do you?
ROSEMARY
Yes.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
Well he’s got mine and I’ve got 
his. He can have it back; it 
doesn’t matter to me how what color 
tie I’m wearing.
ROSEMARY
I didn’t understand. I thought he 
had only borrowed it.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
No, it was a trade. Did you think 
he stole it?
ROSEMARY
I have to hang up now. I just 
wanted to know if there was any 
improvement.
DONALD BAUMGART (O.S.)
No, there isn't. It was nice of you 
to call.
ROSEMARY
'By.
She hangs up; looks at the time (nine after four).
She takes a fold of bills from underneath Guy’s underwear in 
the drawer, puts them in her handbag.
She puts in also the bottle of vitamin capsules and her 
address book. She takes the suitcase standing by the bedroom 
door and goes out. Halfway down the hallway, she turns and 
doubles back. She rides down in the service elevator with TWO 
DELIVERY BOYS.
135.
INT. DR. SAPIRSTEIN’S OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
114
114
Rosemary is standing with her suitcase in front of the 
RECEPTIONIST’S desk. Another woman (MRS. BYRON) sits reading. 
The Receptionist looks at the suitcase and smiles.
RECEPTIONIST
You aren’t in labor, are you?
ROSEMARY
No, but I have to see the doctor. 
It’s very important.
The Receptionist glances.at her watch.
RECEPTIONIST
He has to leave at five and there’s 
Mrs. Byron...
She looks across at Mrs. Byron and then smiles at Rosemary.
RECEPTIONIST
I’m sure he’ll see you. Sit down.
ROSEMARY
Thank you.
Rosemary puts her suitcase by the nearest chair and sits 
down. She opens her handbag, takes out a tissue and wipes her 
pains and then her upper lip and temples. Her hands are 
shaking.
RECEPTIONIST
How is it out there?
ROSEMARY
Terrible. Ninety-four.
The Receptionist makes a pained sound. A PREGNANT WOMAN (5-6 
months) comes out from Dr. Sapirstein's office and nods at 
Rosemary. The Receptionist goes in to Dr. Sapirstein.
PREGNANT WOMAN
(To Rosemary)
You’re due any day now, aren’t you?
ROSEMARY
Tuesday.
PREGNANT WOMAN
You’re smart to get it over with 
before August.
The Receptionist comes out again.
136.
RECEPTIONIST
Mrs. Byron?
(To Rosemary)
He’ll see you right after.
ROSEMARY
Thank you.
Mrs. Byron goes in to Dr. Sapirstein and closes the door. The 
Pregnant Woman by the desk confers with the Receptionist.
RECEPTIONIST
July 10th?
PREGNANT WOMAN
What time?
RECEPTIONIST
Four o’clock?
PREGNANT WOMAN
O.K. Good-by.
She turns and goes out, passing Rosemary, she smiles.
PREGNANT WOMAN
Good luck.
The Receptionist writes. Rosemary takes up a copy of "Time”, 
in red letters on a black background, it says: "Is God dead?"
RECEPTIONIST
That smells nice.
(Sniffing)
What is it?
ROSEMARY
It’s called ’Detchema'.
RECEPTIONIST
It’s a big improvement on your 
regular, if you don’t mind my 
saying.
ROSEMARY
That wasn’t a cologne, it was a 
good luck charm. I threw it away.
RECEPTIONIST
Good. Maybe the doctor will follow 
your example.
ROSEMARY
(After a silence)
137.
Dr. Sapirstein?
RECEPTIONIST
He has the after-shave. But it 
isn’t is it? I don’t think he has a 
good luck charm.
(She laughs)
Anyway, he has the same smell once 
in a while, whatever it is, and 
when he does - oh boy! Haven’t you 
ever noticed?
ROSEMARY
No.
Rosemary puts down the magazine.
RECEPTIONIST
Maybe you thought it was your own 
you were smelling. What is it, a 
chemical thing?
Rosemary is standing up with her suitcase in her hand.
ROSEMARY
My husband is outside. I have to 
tell him something. I’ll be back in 
a minute.
The Receptionist looks surprised as Rosemary backs and runs 
out.
EXT. STREET - (DAY)
115
115
Rosemary, suitcase in hand, walks fast.
INT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY)
116
116
Rosemary enters a glass phone booth, puts the suitcase on the 
floor, takes the address book out of her hand­ bag, finds a 
number and, repeating it to herself, searches in her purse 
for a coin. She finds one, puts it in the slot and starts to 
dial. She is sweating.
A woman’s voice answers.
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Dr. Hill’s office.
ROSEMARY
Dr. Hill, please.
138.
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
This is his answering service. 
Would you like to leave a message?
ROSEMARY
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse. 
Please ask him to call me back 
right away, 475-2498. It’s an 
emergency. I’m in a phone booth.
WOMAN’S VOICE
All right.
With her foot, she cracks the door open for air.
Rosemary replaces the receiver. Wiping her forehead, she 
speaks to herself.
ROSEMARY
Quickly, please, Dr. Hill. Call me.
She notices a WOMAN coming towards the telephone booth.
She steps back, letting the door close and picks up the 
receiver, keeping a hidden finger on the hook.
The Woman stands outside and waits.
ROSEMARY
(To mouthpiece)
Oh, I didn't know that. Really? 
What else did he say? That’s won‐­
derful. Did he say anything else?
The TELEPHONE RINGS. Rosemary jumps and lets her finger off 
the hook. Sweat is pouring down her face.
ROSEMARY
Dr. Hill?
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Did I get the name right? Is it 
’Rosemary Woodhouse’?
The Woman outside the booth is walking away.
ROSEMARY
Yes!
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Are you Dr. Hill’s patient?
ROSEMARY
139.
No. Yes. I mean - I’ve seen him 
once. Please, please, he has to 
speak to me! It’s important! It’s - 
Please tell him to call me.
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
All right.
Rosemary looks around; nobody is waiting; she doesn’t replace 
the receiver though, but puts her finger on the hook. She 
opens the door again and with the hand holding the receiver, 
wipes the sweat from her fore­ head.
ROSEMARY
All of then. All of them. All in it 
together. "All of them Witches”. 
Don’t you worry, Andy-or-Jenny, 
I’ll kill them before I let them 
touch you!
The TELEPHONE RINGS. She jumps her finger from the hook, 
stopping the ring in the middle. She steps forward and the 
door closes.
ROSEMARY
Yes?
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Mrs. Woodhouse?
ROSEMARY
Thank you. Thank you for calling 
me.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
I thought you were in California.
ROSEMARY
No. I went to another doctor, and 
he isn't good, Dr. Hill; he's been 
lying to me and giving me unusual 
kinds of - drinks and capsules. The 
baby is due on Tuesday - remember, 
you told me, June twenty-eight? - 
and I want you to deliver it.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Mrs. Woodhouse -
ROSEMARY
140.
Please, let me talk to you. Let me 
come and explain what’s been going 
on. I can’t stay too long here. 
They will be looking for me. There 
is a plot. I know that sounds 
crazy, Doctor, and you’re probably 
thinking, 'My God, this poor girl 
has completely flipped, ’but I 
haven’t flipped, Doctor, I swear by 
all the saints I haven't. There are 
plots against people, aren't there?
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Yes, I suppose there are.
ROSEMARY
There's one against me and my baby.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Come to my office tomorrow after -
ROSEMARY
Now. Right now.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Mrs. Woodhouse, I’m not.at my 
office now, I’m home. I’ve been up 
since yesterday morning and -
ROSEMARY
I beg you, I beg you.
(Silence)
I can’t stay here.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
My office at eight o'clock.
ROSEMARY
Yes. Thank you.
DR. HILL (O.S.)
All right.
ROSEMARY
Dr. Hill?
DR. HILL (O.S.)
Yes?
ROSEMARY
My husband may call you and ask -
DR. HILL (O.S.)
141.
I'm not going to speak to anyone. 
I'm going to take a nap.
ROSEMARY
Thank you, Dr. Hill.
She replaces the receiver, breathing deeply in relief. She 
notices that somebody is standing outside, back against the 
door. It is a MAN looking like Dr. Saperstein. Rosemary, who 
has been bending to pick up her suitcase, is unable to move. 
She remains in this position for several seconds until the 
MAN turns and looks at her. She straightens up, opens the 
door, and suitcase in hand goes quickly away.
INT. TAXI - (DAY)
117
117
Rosemary is sitting with her suitcase on her knees.
The taxi stops somewhere on West Seventy-second. The driver 
stops the meter and Rosemary gives him money.
She looks anxiously around.
ROSEMARY
Driver, could you wait please, and 
watch until I’m inside the door?
The Driver, a little surprised, hands Rosemary the change.
ROSEMARY
Keep it, please.
EXT. THE DOORWAY OF DR. HILL’S OFFICE -(DAY)
118
118
She gets out, shrinks, trying to be as small as possible, and 
hurries to the door.
Dr. Hill opens it. He wears a blue and yellow plaid sport 
shirt. He had grown a moustache, blond and hardly noticeable. 
He shows Rosemary inside.
INT. DR. HILL’S OFFICE - CONSULTING ROOM - (DAY)
119
119
Rosemary sits in an armchair. Dr. Hill sits beside the desk.
ROSEMARY
142.
You see, he lied to you. He said we 
were going to Hollywood. The worst 
thing of all, he is involved with 
them as well. He sleeps in pajamas 
now. He never used to before. He’s 
probably hiding a mark. You know, 
they give you a mark when you join. 
All sorts of rituals. They hold 
Sabbaths there. You could hear them 
singing through the wall. Guy, my 
husband, said it was Dr. Shand, one 
of these people, playing a 
recorder. Now, how did he know it 
was Dr. Shand unless he was there 
with them? They’re very clever. 
They planned everything from the 
beginning. I suppose they made some 
sort of a deal with Guy. They gave 
him success and he promised them a 
baby. To use in their rituals. I 
know, this sounds crazy, but I’ve 
got hooks here. I’ll show them to 
you.
Rosemary opens her suitcase, takes the two books out of it, 
finds a place in the large one and hands it to Dr. Hill.
ROSEMARY
There was another actor like him, 
Donald Baumgart, and they cast a 
spell on him to make him blind, so 
Guy could get his part. Look. Here!
Dr. Hill looks at the place. He puts the book on the desk and 
holding his hand on the page, reads it. While Rosemary is 
speaking, Dr. Hill examines the cover and starts flicking 
through the leaves.
ROSEMARY
I had a friend, Edward Hutchins. 
Maybe you heard of him? A writer. 
He wrote for boys. Anyway, he was a 
friend of mine since I first came 
to New York.
DR. HILL
(Holding book)
May I keep it?
ROSEMARY
Yes, please.
Rosemary gives him the smaller book also. Dr. Hill puts it on 
top of the larger one at the side of his desk.
143.
ROSEMARY
Once, Mr. Hutchins came to visit 
me. It was the time I had this 
pain. I was suffering so much, 
Doctor, you can't imagine how much 
I was suffer­ing. And they wouldn't 
help me. Nobody would. They were 
giving me a drink, with tannis 
root. Also a witch stuff. Tannis 
root. So, Hutch came and 
immediately saw some­ thing was 
wrong. He knew about witches, you 
see. Suddenly Guy rushed in with 
his make-up still on, which he 
never did. They must have called 
him to get home and steal one of 
Hutch's belongings. So he did. Took 
his glove, and they cast a spell on 
him too. Put him in a coma. Three 
months later he died. Maybe all 
this is coincidence but one thing 
is certain. They have a coven and 
they want my baby.
DR. HILL
It certainly seems that way.
Rosemary shuts her eyes and almost cries from happi­ness, that 
Dr. Hill believes her. She opens her eyes and looks at him, 
calm and composed. Dr. Hill had moved behind the desk and is 
writing. Rosemary, who was clutching the chair arms, relaxes 
her hands and dries her palm on her dress.
ROSEMARY
I was afraid you wouldn’t believe 
me.
DR. HILL
(Writing)
I don’t believe in witchcraft but 
there are plenty of maniacs and 
crazy people in this city. The 
doctor’s name is Shand, you say.
ROSEMARY
No, Dr. Shand is one of the group. 
The doctor is Dr. Sapirstein.
DR. HILL
Abraham Sapirstein?
ROSEMARY
Yes.
(Uneasily)
144.
Do you know him?
DR. HILL
(Writing)
I met him once or twice.
ROSEMARY
Looking at, him, you would never 
think he -
DR. HILL
Never in a million years.
(Putting down his pen)
Would you like to go into Mount 
Sinai right now, this evening?
ROSEMARY
(Smiling)
I would love to. Is it possible?
DR. HILL
Difficult but we’ll try. I want you 
to lie down and get some rest.
He rises and goes to the open door of his examining room, 
reaches inside and switches on an ice-blue fluorescent light.
DR. HILL
I’ll see what I can do, then I’ll 
check you over.
Rosemary hefts herself up and goes, clutching her hand­ bag, 
into the examining room.
ROSEMARY
Anything you’re got. Even a broom 
closet.
DR. HILL
T hope we can do better than that.
He comes into the examining room after her. There is a day 
bed at the far end of the room covered in blue, and a chair. 
There are blue curtains on the window.
Dr. Hill switches on the air conditioner in the window. It is 
a noisy one.
ROSEMARY
Shall I undress?
DR. HILL
145.
No, not yet. It'll take some half-
hour on the telephone. Just lie 
down and rest.
He switches off the light, goes out and closes the door. 
There is a nice glow of evening light from behind the 
curtains. Rosemary puts her handbag on a chair, and sits down 
heavily on the day bed.
ROSEMARY
(Sighing)
God bless Dr. Hill.
She shakes off her sandals and lies back gratefully.
ROSEMARY
Everything's okay now, Andy-or-
Jenny. We’re going to be in a nice 
clean bed with no Visitors and -
She sits up suddenly, opens her handbag, takes out the fold 
of bills and counts them. There is some more money in her 
purse. She takes it out and adds it to the fold of bills. She 
takes the capsules out of her handbag, puts the money back 
in, closes it and puts it on the chair. She looks at the 
bottle of capsules in her hand.
ROSEMARY
Monsters!
She puts the bottle on the chair beside the handbag, lies 
back again on the day bed.
ROSEMARY
Unspeakable. Unspeakable.
EXT. DREAM SEQUENCE - (DAY)
120
120
In front of a large contemporary house in Beverly Hills, 
Rosemary rocks a bassinet. There are ten to twelve persons 
around? her family and some of her friends.
Looking over shoulders, each one tries to see into the 
bassinet. Rosemary picks up the baby.
ROSEMARY
He’ll be four months in two days.
A MAN
Already talking?
Rosemary cradles the baby in her arms. Elise Dunstan bends 
over it, making cooing noises.
146.
ELISE
Andy, Andy!
INT. EXAMINING ROOM - (DUSK)
121
121
The door opens. Dr. Hill looks in. Rosemary, lying on the day 
bed, looks at him. Dr. Hill switches on the fluorescent 
light. Rosemary shields her eyes with her hand and smiles at 
him.
ROSEMARY
I’ve been sleeping.
Dr. Hill withdraws, pushing the door wide open. Guy and Dr. 
Sapirstein come in. Rosemary sits up, lower­ing her hand from 
her eyes. They come and stand close to her. Guy's face is 
stony and blank. He looks at the walls, not at her.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Come with us quietly, Rosemary. 
Don’t argue or make a scene, 
because if you say anything more 
about witches or witchcraft we’re 
going to be forced to take you to a 
mental hospital. You don’t want 
that, do you? So put your shoes on.
Guy finally looks at her.
GUY
We’re just going to take you home. 
No one’s going to hurt you.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Or the baby. Put your shoes on.
He picks up the bottle of capsules, looks at it, and puts it 
in his pocket. Rosemary puts her sandals on and Dr. 
Sapirstein gives her the handbag. They go out, Dr. Sapirstein 
holding her arm, Guy touching her other elbow. Dr. Hill gives 
Rosemary’s suitcase to Guy.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
(To Dr. Hill)
She’s fine now.
(To Rosemary)
We’re going to go home and rest.
Dr. Hill smiles at Rosemary.
DR. HILL
That’s all it takes.
147.
Rosemary looks at Dr. Hill and says nothing.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Thank you for your trouble, Doctor.
GUY
It’s a shame you had to come in 
here and -
DR. HILL
(To Dr. Sapirstein)
I’m glad I could be of help, sir.
Dr. Hill opens the door. They go out.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DR. HILL’S OFFICE - (DUSK)
122
122
There is a car waiting with Mr. Gilmore at the wheel.
Rosemary sits in the back between Guy and Dr. Sapirstein. The 
suitcase is put on the front seat.
Nobody says anything; they drive in silence.
INT. BRAMFORD LOBBY - (NIGHT)
123
123
Guy, Rosemary and Dr. Sapirstein walk across the lobby 
towards the elevator. Diego smiles at Rosemary from the open 
door of the elevator. As they walk Rosemary sneaks open her 
handbag at her side, hooks a finger through the key ring and 
holding onto the keys, spills the handbag onto the floor near 
the elevator.
There are coins, rolling lipstick, bills fluttering all over 
the floor. Rosemary looks down stupidly.
Guy and Dr. Sapirstein start to pick the contents up.
Diego comes out to help them, making tongue-teeth sounds of 
concern.
INT. ELEVATOR - (NIGHT)
124
124
Rosemary backs into the elevator to get out of the way. 
Watching them, she toes the big round floor­ button. The 
rolling door rolls. She pulls closed the inner gate.
Diego grabs for the door but saves his fingers; smacks the 
outside.
DIEGO (O.S.)
148.
Hey, Mrs. Woodhouse!
Rosemary pushes the handle and the car lurches upward.
She overruns the elevator car to the ninth floor, then back 
to between six and seven, eventually just above seven. She 
opens the gates and steps down.
INT. HALLWAY - (NIGHT)
125
125
She runs through the turns of hallway as quickly as she can. 
As she reaches the landing near the apartment door, she 
stops, holding her middle, leaning against the wall, 
breathing shallowly. She sees the service elevator indicator, 
light blink for the fourth then fifth floor. Rosemary dashes 
for the door; the key won't go in.
The service elevator door opens; Guy and Dr. Sapirstein come 
out, rushing towards Rosemary.
The apartment door opens; Rosemary stumbles in. She slams the 
door behind her, chains it and bolts it, leans against it, 
breathing. We hear a key being put into the lock; immediately 
the door opens against the chain. We can see Guy's face and 
the tips of his fingers through the crack.
GUY
Open up, Ro.
ROSEMARY
Go to hell.
GUY
I’m not going to hurt you, honey.
ROSEMARY
You promised them the baby. Get 
away.
GUY
I didn't promise them anything. 
What are you talking about? 
Promised who?
DR. SAPIRSTEIN (O.S.)
Rosemary.
ROSEMARY
You too. Get away.
149.
She pushes the door shut and bolts it. She backs away 
watching it. It stays bolted. Rosemary goes to the Bedroom. 
The time is nine-thirty. She picks up the phone and dials. 
Still holding the phone, Rosemary steps towards the door and 
looks down the hallway towards the front door. There is 
quiet, the door is still closed. She steps back and sits on 
the bed.
BABY SITTER (O.S.)
Hello.
ROSEMARY
Elise?
BABY SITTER (O.S.)
Mrs. Dunstan is out.
ROSEMARY
Who is this?
BABY SITTER (O.S.)
The baby sitter.
ROSEMARY
Do you know where she is?
BABY SITTER (O.S.)
They went to the movies.
ROSEMARY
This is Rosemary. Please tell Mrs. 
Dunstan to call Rosemary the second 
she gets back. It’s terribly 
urgent. Please don’t forget.
BABY SITTER (O.S.)
Don’t worry.
She hangs up, and stares at the telephone. We can hear 
whispers and footsteps.
GUY
Honey, we’re not going to hurt you.
Rosemary stands up.
Guy is in the doorway with Mr. Fountain. Behind them, Dr. 
Sapirstein with a loaded hypodermic, the needle up and 
dripping his thumb at the plunger. Other people appear behind 
them: Mrs. Gilmore, Mrs. Fountain, Dr. Shand.
MRS. GILMORE
We’re your friends.
150.
MRS. FOUNTAIN
There’s nothing to be afraid of, 
Rosemary; honest and truly there 
isn’t.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
This is nothing but a mild sedative 
to calm you down.
Rosemary is between the bed and the wall. They come toward 
her.
GUY
You know I wouldn’t let anyone hurt 
you, Ro?
Rosemary picks up the phone and strikes with the receiver at 
Guy’s head. He catches her wrist. Mr. Fountain catches her 
other arm and the phone falls as he pulls her around with 
startling strength.
ROSEMARY
(Screaming)
Help me, somebody!
A handkerchief is jammed into her mouth and held there by a 
small strong hand. They drag her away from the bed so Dr. 
Sapirstein can come in front of her with the hypodermic and a 
dab of cotton.
Rosemary moans through the handkerchief; a contraction; she 
clenches shut her eyes, holds her breath, then sucks air in 
through her nostrils in quick little pulls. A hand feels her 
belly deftly.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute now; 
we happen to be in labor here.
Silence. Whispers outside the room.
VOICE (O.S.)
She’s in labor.
Rosemary opens her eyes and stares at Dr. Sapirstein, 
dragging air in through her nostrils. He nods at her, takes 
her arm that Mr. Fountain is holding, touches it with cotton 
and jabs the needle into it.
Rosemary takes the injection without moving. Dr. Sapirstein 
withdraws the needle and rubs the spot with his thumb, then 
with the cotton. The women are turning down the bed.
MRS. GILMORE
151.
Here?
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Here.
Rosemary struggles. In the confusion of this scene we hear 
Rosemary’s voice, without knowing if she is saying the words-
or if they are her thoughts. At the same time, Guy is 
speaking into Rosemary's ear.
ROSEMARY
It was supposed to be Doctors 
Hospital! Doctors Hospital, with 
nurses and everything clean and 
sterile!
GUY
You'll be all right, honey, I swear 
to God you will! Don't go on 
fighting like this, Ro, please 
don't! I give you my absolute word 
of honor you're going to be 
perfectly all right!
Another contraction. Dr. Sapirstein gives Rosemary another 
injection. Mrs. Gilmore wipes Rosemary's forehead. The 
telephone rings.
GUY
She isn’t here Elise, I’ll have her 
call you back.
Another contraction. Darkness. We hear Rosemary's voice.
ROSEMARY
Oh, Andy, Andy-or-Jenny! I’m sorry, 
my little darling. Forgive me!
INT. BEDROOM - (DAY) - JUNE 25, 1966
126
126
After a long moment of darkness - light. The ceiling. Guy 
sitting beside the bed watching Rosemary with an anxious, 
uncertain smile.
GUY
Hi.
ROSEMARY
Hi.
(Long pause)
Is it all right?
GUY
152.
Yes, fine.
ROSEMARY
What is it?
GUY
A boy.
ROSEMARY
Really? A boy?
Guy nods.
ROSEMARY
And it’s all right?
GUY
Yes.
Rosemary lets her eyes close, then manages to open them 
again.
ROSEMARY
Did you call Tiffany's?
GUY
Yes.
Rosemary lets her eyes close and sleeps.
INT. BEDROOM - (NIGHT)
127
127
Next to the bed in which Rosemary is sleeping, Laura-Louise 
sits reading the "Reader’s Digest” with a magnifying glass.
ROSEMARY
Where is it?
Laura-Louise jumps, drops the book and presses the magnifying 
glass to her bosom.
LAURA-LOUISE
My goodness, dear, what a start you 
gave me. My goodness!
She closes her eyes and breathes deeply.
ROSEMARY
The baby: where is it?
LAURA-LOUISE
You just wait here a minute.
153.
She gets up, retrieves the "Reader’s Digest", and goes toward 
the door.
ROSEMARY
Where’s the baby?
LAURA-LOUISE (O.S.)
(From the hallway)
I’ll get Doctor Abe. Just wait.
Rosemary tries to get up but falls back, her arms bone­ less. 
She looks at the clock. It’s half past six.
Guy and Dr. Sapirstein come in looking grave and resolute.
ROSEMARY
Where’s the baby?
Guy comes around to the side of the bed, crouches down and 
takes her hand.
GUY
Honey.
ROSEMARY
Where is it?
GUY
Honey...
He tries to say more but can’t. He looks across the bed for 
help. Dr. Sapirstein stands looking down at Rosemary.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
There were complications, Rosemary, 
but nothing; that till effect 
future births.
ROSEMARY
It’s -
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Dead.
Rosemary stares at Dr. Sapirstein. He nods. She turns to Guy. 
He nods too.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
It was in the wrong position, In 
the; hospital I might have been 
able to do something, but you 
wouldn’t listen -
GUY
154.
We can have others, honey, just as 
soon as you’re better, I promise 
you.
DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Absolutely. You can start on 
another in a very few months.
Guy squeezes Rosemary’s hand and smiles encouragingly at her.
GUY
As soon as you’re better.
Rosemary looks at them.
ROSEMARY
You’re lying. I don’t believe you. 
You're both lying.
GUY
Honey.
ROSEMARY
It didn’t die. You took it. You’re 
lying. You're witches. You’re - 
lying! You’re lying! You’re lying! 
You’re lying! You’re lying! You’re 
lying! You’re lying!
Guy holds her shoulders to the bed and Dr. Sapirstein gives 
her an injection.

Rosemary in bed with a tray of soup and buttered white bread 
on her lap. Guy, standing, hands her a glass of water and a 
small white pill. Rosemary takes it.
GUY
Abe says it’s called Prepartum I-
don't-know, some kind of hysteria. 
You were really kapow out of your 
mind.
Rosemary says nothing; she takes a spoonful of soup. Guy sits 
on the edge of the bed, and starts nibbling at one of the 
bread triangles.
GUY
Listen, I know how you got the idea 
Minnie and Roman were witches, but 
what made you think Abe and I had 
joined the party?
155.
Rosemary says nothing. Guy takes another of the bread 
triangles and bites off first one point and then another.
GUY
Let's face it, darling, you had the 
prepartum crazies. Now you’re going 
to rest and get over them.
(Leaning closer and 
taking her hand)
I know this is the worst thing that 
ever happened to you, but from now 
on everything’s going to be roses. 
Paramount is within an inch of 
where we want them, and suddenly 
Universal is interested too. We’re 
going to blow this town and be in 
the beautiful hills of Beverly, 
with the pool and the spice garden 
and the whole schmeer. And the 
kids, too, Ro. Scout's honor. You 
heard what Abe said.
(He kisses her hand)
Got to run now and get ’famous.
He gets up and starts for the door.
ROSEMARY
Let me see your shoulder.
Guy stops and turns.
ROSEMARY
Let me see your shoulder.
GUY
Are you kidding?
ROSEMARY
Left shoulder.
Guy looks at her.
GUY
All right, whatever you say, honey.
He undoes the collar of his short-sleeved blue knit shirt and 
peels it up over his head. Underneath is a white T shirt.
GUY
I generally prefer doing this to 
music.
156.
He takes off the T shirt; goes close to the bed, leans and 
shows Rosemary his left shoulder. It is unmarked. There is 
only a faint scar of a boil or pimple. Guy shows his other 
shoulder, his chest and back.
GUY
(Grinning)
This is as far as I go without a 
blue light.

Rosemary is lying in bed watching television. We hear the 
faint sound of a baby crying. Rosemary rays off the 
television and listens. She slips out of bed and turns off 
the air conditioner. FLORENCE GILMORE comes in with a pump 
and cup, glass of water and small white pill on a tray.
ROSEMARY
Do you hear a baby crying?
They both listen. We hear a baby cry.
MRS. GILMORE
No, dear, I don’t. Get back into 
bed now. Take your pill.
She hands Rosemary the tray and switches on the air 
conditioner. Rosemary puts the pill under the mattress.
MRS. GILMORE
Did you turn it off? You mustn’t do 
that. People are actually dying, 
it’s so hot.
Mrs. Gilmore looks out the window.

Rosemary lying in bed. Laura-Louise sitting beside, holding 
the tray, with the pump and cup, glass of water and small 
white pill.
ROSEMARY
What do you do with it?
(Indicating the milk)
LAURA-LOUISE
Why, throw it away.
Guy comes in. He puts his head around the doo
157.
GUY
Hello, girls, Phew! Ninety-five 
outside.
LAURA-LOUISE
Your pill, Rosemary.
Rosemary takes the pill, lifts it to her mouth and fakes 
swallowing it, She takes the glass of water and drinks it. 
Simultaneously, with her other hand, she slips the pill under 
the mattress. Eight or ten other pills are already there. Guy 
calls from the other room.
GUY (O.SO)
Some new people moved in. Up on 
eight.
ROSEMARY
Do they have a baby?
Guy’s head appears once again in the doorway,
GUY
How did you know?
ROSEMARY
I heard it crying.
There is a cup and saucer on the bedside with remains of 
coffee and a dirty spoon beside it, Rosemary takes the cup 
and puts it on the tray. She lifts the dirty spoon and starts 
putting it into the Pyrex cup of milk, Laura-Louise grabs her 
hand.
LAURA-LOUISE
Don’t do that!
ROSEMARY
What difference does it make?
LAURA-LOUISE
Just messy, that’s all.
INT. BEDROOM - (DUSK)

Rosemary gets out of bed, slides her feet into slip­pers, the 
puts on her housecoat. Going quietly out of the bedroom, she 
walks to the linen closet and opens it. The shelves look neat 
and orderly piled with bath towels, hand towels and winter 
blankets.
158.
Rosemary takes everything out of the closet except what is on 
the fixed top shelf. She puts towels and linens on the floor, 
then lifts out the four gingham-covered shelves. The back of 
the closet, below the top shelf, is a single large white-
painted panel framed with narrow white molding. Standing 
close and leaning aside for better light, Rosemary can see 
that where the panel and the molding meet, the paint is 
broken in a continuous line. She presses at one side of the 
panel and then at the others presses harder, and it swings 
inward on scraping hinges. Within is darkness a second closet 
with a wire hanger glinting on the floor, and one bright spot 
of light, a keyhole. Pushing the panel all the way open, 
Rosemary steps into the second closet and ducks down.
Through the keyhole, Rosemary sees at a distance a small 
curio cabinet that stands at a job in the hall­ way of Mr. and 
Mrs. Castevetfs apartment, Rosemary tries the door. It opens. 
She closes it and backs out through her own closet and goes 
to the kitchen.
From her knife-rack, Rosemary takes the longest sharpest 
carving knife. As she is leaving the kitchen, we hear a key 
working in the lock of the front door, Rosemary rushes into 
the nursery, brushing against the new bassinet, and presses 
herself against the wall.
Guy enters and goes into the kitchen, opens the fridge and 
takes out ice cubes.
Rosemary sees that the bassinet is swinging. She stops it 
with the point of the long knife.
Guy comes out of the kitchen with Hutch’s ice bucket in his 
hand. He opens the entrance door and goes out.
Rosemary listens for a moment, then moves out to the front 
door and chains it. Holding the knife point­ down at her side, 
she goes down the hallway to the linen closet door. She opens 
it, goes through again into the second closet (quick glance 
at the under­neath of the fixed top shelf like in the dream), 
looks through the keyhole and cracks open the door into the 
Castevet’s apartment. Holding the knife point forward, 
Rosemary pushes the door wide open and steps through. The 
hallway is empty. There are distant voices from the living 
room. The bathroom is on Rosemary’s righty its door open, 
dark; the Castevet’s bedroom on the left, with a bedside lamp 
burn­ing. She goes cautiously down the hallway and tries a 
door on the right; it is locked. Another, on the left, is a 
linen closet. Over the curio cabinet hangs a vivid oil 
painting of a church in flames.
ROSEMARY
(Almost inaudible)
- got her too high.
159.
Knife high, she follows the jog to the left and the right. 
Other doors are locked. There is another painting; nude men 
and women dancing in a circle. Ahead are the foyer, the front 
door and the archway on the right to the living room. The 
voices are louder.
MR. FOUNTAIN (O.S.)
Not if he’s still waiting for a 
plane, he isn’t!
There is laughter and then hushing.
MRS. CASTEVET (O.S.)
Oh hell now, Hayato, you’re just 
making fun of me! ’Pulling my leg’ 
is what we say over here.
Rosemary is at the archway now. She can see the coven is at 
the other end, laughing, talking softly. Ice cubes clink. She 
betters her grip on the knife and moves a step forward. She 
stops, staring.
Across the room, in the one large window bay; stands a black 
bassinet, skirted with black taffeta, hooded and flounced 
with black organza. A silver ornament turns on a black ribbon 
pinned to its black hood.
The stiff organza trembles. The silver ornament quivers and 
we can see that it is a crucifix hanging upside down, with 
the black ribbon wound and knotted around Jesus’ ankles.
Rosemary wipes her hands on her housecoat, throws back her 
hair, finds a fresh grip on the knife’s thick handle, and 
steps out where they can see-her.
Insanely, they don’t. They go right on talking, listening, 
sipping, pleasantly partying; Mr. and Mrs. Castevet, Guy, Mr. 
Fountain, the Weeses, Laura-Louise and a studious-looking' 
young Japanese with eye-glasses. All gathered under an over-
the-mantel portrait of Adrian Marcato (the same as in the 
book).
Mr. Castevet sees Rosemary first, puts down his drink and 
touches Mrs. Castevet’s arm. The voices fade. Those who sit 
with their back to Rosemary turn around questioningly. Guy 
starts to rise but sits down again. Laura-Louise claps both 
hands to her mouth and starts squealing.
MRS. GILMORE
Get back in bed, Rosemary; you know 
you aren’t supposed to be up and 
around.
JAPANESE
160.
Is the mother?
Mr. Castevet nods and the Japanese looks at Rosemary with 
interest.
JAPANESE
Ah, sssssssssssss.
Watching them, Rosemary starts across the room toward the 
bassinet.
MR. CASTEVET
Rosemary.
ROSEMARY
Shut up.
MR. CASTEVET
Before you look at -
ROSEMARY
Shut up. You’re in Dubrovnik. I 
don’t hear you.
Rosemary watched them until she is by the bassinet, which is 
angled in their direction. With her free hand, she catches 
the black-covered handle and swings the bassinet slowly, 
gently, around to face her.
Taffeta rustles, the black wheels squeal. She looks in. 
Smiling gently, she slowly reaches her left arm to take the 
baby. The smile fades on her face and changes into an 
expression of horror. She backs slowly away and freezes with 
her eyes wide open.
ROSEMARY
What have you done to it? What have 
you done to its eyes?
They stir and look to Mr. Castevet.
MR. CASTEVET
He has His Father’s eyes.
Rosemary looks at him, looks at Guy - whose eyes^ are hidden 
behind a hand - looks at Mr. Castevet again.
ROSEMARY
What are you talking about? Guy’s 
eyes are norma1I What have you done 
to him, you maniacs?
She moves from the bassinet, ready to kill him.
161.
MR. CASTEVET
Satan is His Father, not Guy. He 
came up from Hell and begat a Son 
of mortal woman!
MR. WEES
Hail Satan.
Mr. Castevet cries, his voice growing louder and prouder, his 
bearing more strong and forceful.
MR. CASTEVET
Satan is His Father and His Name is 
Adrian! He shall overthrow the 
mighty and lay waste their temples! 
He shall redeem the despised and 
wreak vengeance in the name of the 
burned and the tortured! Hail 
Adrian!
VOICES
Hail Adrian! Hail Adrian!
MR. CASTEVET
Hail Satan! Hail Satan.
VOICES
Hail Satan!
Rosemary shakes her head.
ROSEMARY
No.
MRS. CASTEVET
He chose you out of all, the world, 
Rosemary. Out of all the women in 
the whole world, He chose you. He 
arranged everything 'cause He 
wanted you to be the mother of His 
only living Son.
MR. CASTEVET
His power is stronger than 
stronger.
MRS. WEES
Hail Satan.
MR. CASTEVET
His might will last longer than 
longer.
JAPANESE
162.
Hail Satan!
Laura-Louise uncovers her mouth. Guy looks out at Rosemary 
from under his hand.
ROSEMARY
No, it can't be. No.
MRS. CASTEVET
Go look at His hands.
LAURA-LOUISE
And His feet.
ROSEMARY
Oh God.
She covers her face. The knife falls into the floor and 
sways, upright.
MR. CASTEVET
(Thundering)
God is DEAD!
ROSEMARY
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!
MR. CASTEVET
God is dead. Satan lives! The year 
is One.
VOICES
Hail Satan! Hail Adrian! Hail 
Adrian! Hail Satan!
MR. CASTEVET
The year is One, God is done! The 
year is One, Adrian’s begun!
Rosemary backs away.
ROSEMARY
No, no.
She backs further and further away through the shouting 
people. In the confusion of movement, a faint fragment of her 
dream flashes. A chair is behind her; she sits down on it and 
stares at them. Mrs. Castevet goes over and, grunting as she 
stoops, pulls out the knife and takes it into the kitchen. 
Guy follows her. Laura-Louise rocks the bassinet 
possessively, making faces into it. Rosemary sits staring. 
Mr. Castevet comes over to her.
MR. CASTEVET
163.
Why don’t you help us out, 
Rosemary, be a real mother to 
Adrian. You don't have to join if 
you don’t want to; just be a mother 
to your baby.
(Bends down and whispers)
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too 
old. It's not right.
Rosemary looks at Mr. Castevet. He straightens up. The 
doorbell rings.
MR. CASTEVET
Think about it, Rosemary.
He goes to answer the door.
ROSEMARY
Oh God.
LAURA-LOUISE
(Rocking the bassinet)
Shut up with your ’Oh God's, or 
we'll kill you, milk or no milk.
MRS. WEES
You shut up.
She comes to Rosemary and puts a dampened handkerchief in her 
hand.
MRS. WEES
Rosemary is His mother, so you show 
some respect.
Laura-Louise mutters.
Rosemary wipes her forehead and cheeks with the hand­ 
kerchief. The Japanese, sitting across the room on a hassock, 
catches Rosemary's eye, grins and ducks his head. He holds up 
an opened camera into which he is putting film. Rosemary 
looks down and starts crying.
Mr. Castevet comes in, holding the arm of ARGYRON 
STAVROPOULOS. He is a robust, handsome, dark-skinned man, 
wearing a white suit, white shoes and carrying a large box 
wrapped in light blue paper patterned with Teddy bears and 
candy canes. Musical sounds come from it.
Everyone gathers to meet him and shake his hand.
164.
There is a confused, hushed conversation from which words 
like "Worried - pleasure — airport - Stavropoulos — occasion" 
can be heard. Laura-Louise brings the box to the bassinet. 
She holds it up for the baby to see, shakes it, and puts it 
on the window seat. There are other boxes similarly wrapped 
and a few that are wrapped in black with black ribbon.
Mr. Castevet draws Argyron Stavropoulos forward.
MR. CASTEVET
Come, my friend. Come see Him. Come 
see the Child.
They go to the bassinet. Laura-Louise waits with a 
proprietary smile. They close around it and look into it 
silently. Argyron Stavropoulos lowers himself to his knees.
Guy comes back from the kitchen, over to Rosemary. He stands 
looking down at her.
GUY
They promised me you wouldn't be 
hurt, and you haven't been, really. 
I mean, suppose you'd had a baby 
and lost it; wouldn’t it be the 
same? And we're getting so much in 
return, Ro.
Rosemary puts the handkerchief on the table, looks at Guy, 
and, as hard as she can, spits at him. Guy flushes and turns 
away, wiping his face.
Laura-Louise rocks the bassinet. The baby starts whimpering. 
Mr. Castevet catches Guy by the arm.
MR. CASTEVET
Guy, let me introduce you to 
Argyron Stavropoulos.
Argyron Stavropoulos clasps Guy's hand in both his own.
STAVROPOULOS
How proud you must be.
He looks over Guy's shoulder, at Rosemary.
STAVROPOULOS
Is this the mother? Why in the name 
of -
Mr. Castevet draws him away, speaking in his ear. Mrs. 
Castevet brings a mug of steaming tea to Rosemary.
MRS. CASTEVET
165.
Here. Drink this and you'll feel a 
little better.
Rosemary looks at the mug and looks up at Mrs. Castevet.
ROSEMARY
What’s in it? Tannis root?
MRS. CASTEVET
Nothing is in it. It’s plain 
ordinary Lipton tea. You drink it,
Rosemary looks at Laura-Louise rocking the bassinet.
The baby is still whimpering, and Laura-Louise rocks it 
faster and faster. Rosemary gets up and goes over,
LAURA-LOUISE
Get away from here. Roman!
ROSEMARY
You’re rocking him too fast.
LAURA-LOUISE
Sit down!
(To Mr. Castevet)
Get her out of here. Put her where 
she belongs.
ROSEMARY
You’re rocking him too fast. That’s 
why he’s whimpering.
LAURA-LOUISE
Mind your own business!
MR. CASTEVET
Let Rosemary rock Him.
Laura-Louise stares at him. He stands behind the bassinet’s 
head.
MR. CASTEVET
Go on. Sit down with tthe others. 
Let Rosemary rock Him.
LAURA-LOUISE
She's liable -
MR. CASTEVET
Sit down with the others, Laura-
Louise.
Laura-Louise huffs and marches away.
166.
MR. CASTEVET
Rock him.
He smiles at Rosemary and moves the bassinet back and forth 
towards her, holding it by its hood. Rosemary stands still 
and looks at him;
ROSEMARY
You’re trying to get me to be his 
mother.
MR. CASTEVET
Aren’t you His mother?
Slowly, Rosemary lets the black-covered handle come into her 
hand, and closes her fingers around it. For a few moments 
they rock the bassinet between them, then Mr. Castevet lets 
go and Rosemary rocks it alone, nice and slowly. Mr. Castevet 
withdraws silently to where everybody now stands in a semi-
circle, watching.
Dr. Sapirstein comes into the room and looks at the scene, in 
surprise. Mrs. Castevet puts her finger to her lips. The 
Japanese steps forward and crouching down to find an angle, 
clicks his camera. Very softly, Rosemary is humming. From 
behind the window, we can hear the distant noise of the 
street and cars hooting. The sun has already set behind the 
buildings and the pleasant evening light covers the city.
THE END
