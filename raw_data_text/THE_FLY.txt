INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
1
1
We are close on the face of SETH BRUNDLE, aging molecular 
physics wunderkind. He is not aging too badly, however, and 
looks much younger than his 38 years - playful child face, 
slightly heavy - a big kid. Even his arrogance is somehow 
engaging, especially now as he talks to someone who is, for 
the moment, off camera. Someone he seems eager to impress.
BRUNDLE
What am I working on? I’m working 
on something that will change the 
world and human life as we know it.
The off-camera voice that replies is female and matter-of-
fact, and belongs to VERONICA QUAIFE, who is evidently 
someone not likely to be easily impressed.
VERONICA (OC)
Change it a lot or just a bit? 
You’ll have to be more specific.
Brundle lifts a glass of Scotch to his mouth and takes a sip. 
He glances around the room which we have not yet seen.
BRUNDLE
You want me to be specific here, in 
this room, with half the scientific 
community of North America 
eavesdropping?
CUT TO VERONICA
who is a very attractive woman in her mid-twenties. She is as 
focused and analytical as Brundle is sloppy and puppyish. She 
toys with a drink but does not taste it.
VERONICA
Is there another way?
Brundle chews nervously on a fingernail.
BRUNDLE
You could come back to my lab. I’ll 
make you a cappuccino. I have a 
Faema of my very own. Not the 
dilettante’s plastic kitchen model. 
A real restaurant espresso machine.
Veronica studies Brundle carefully.
VERONICA
Somehow I get the feeling you don’t 
get out much.
2.
BRUNDLE
(AMAZED)
You can tell that?
VERONICA
Yeah.
BRUNDLE
Actually I’ve been alone working 
for a long time now.
Veronica picks up her bag - it's big and leathery and full of 
notes and books - and starts to move off through the room. 
Brundle grabs his drink and follows her. Scotch slops all 
over Brundle's hand and cuff, but he doesn't seem to notice 
it.
BRUNDLE
Hey! How about it? Are you coming 
with me?
VERONICA
Sorry, I've got three other 
interviews to do before the party's 
over.
We pop back and take a look at the room Brundle and Veronica 
are in. It is an enormous HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM full of 
rather eccentric science types. A GAUDY BANNER running the 
entire length of the room proclaims:
BARTOK science industries
FOURTH ANNUAL
MEET-THE-PRESS LUNCHEON.
Brundle has to struggle through the crowd to keep Veronica 
within earshot.
BRUNDLE
Yeah. But they're not working on 
something that will change the 
world as we know it.
VERONICA
They say they are.
Brundle manages to wedge himself in front of Veronica and 
slow her down. He takes a quick sip of his drink, but there's 
almost nothing left: it's all on his sleeve.
BRUNDLE
Yeah, but they’re lying.
3.
(PAUSE)
I'm not.
Veronica takes a closer look at Brundle. Despite his soggy 
sleeves, he is very convincing.
INT. VERONICA’S CAR - NIGHT

Veronica drives through the night in her clapped-out Renault 
Le Car. Brundle is turning green.
VERONICA
Are you sick?
BRUNDLE
(QUEASY NONCHALANCE)
Oh, sure.
VERONICA
You’re not a very accomplished 
drunk.
BRUNDLE
I’m always like this. Motion 
sickness. When I was a kid I puked 
on my tricycle. I hate vehicles.
VERONICA
Should I drive more slowly?
BRUNDLE
No, just turn left. We’re almost 
there.
EXT. LAB WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Le Car pulls up outside a huge, dilapidated warehouse by the 
waterfront under a freeway. Veronica helps Brundle out of the 
car.
VERONICA
This is it?
BRUNDLE
It's cleaner on the inside.
INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWAY - NIGHT
4

Veronica and Brundle climb the warped wooden stairs to the 
fourth floor. Brundle is breathing hard, very out of shape. 
He uses the ornate railing to haul himself from step to step.
4.
VERONICA
Nice rai1ings.
BRUNDLE
(BREATHING HARD)
Yeah. They’re original.
VERONICA
You doing marine experiments?
BRUNDLE
No, why?
VERONICA
That fishy smell.
BRUNDLE
Oh, that. Used to be a packing 
house for fish. It’s deserted right 
now, except for me. I’ve got the 
whole fourth floor. The top floor.
VERONICA
Want me to carry you?
BRUNDLE
Maybe next time.
INT. LAB - NIGHT
5
5
Veronica and Brundle enter Brundle’s lab through an ancient 
steel-and-rotting-wood sliding door. It is immediately 
obvious that the lab is not just a lab: Brundle lives here, 
and he lives messy. There is junk everywhere, amongst which 
are a couple of mattresses lying on the floor.
The immense warehouse space is only partially divided by a 
couple of brick half-walls and by the square wooden pillars 
which soar up to a system of interlocking sky 1ights above.
Almost unnoticed amid the chaos stand TWO GLASS BOOTHS with 
molded plastic bases. They are at opposite ends of the room 
and look very much like an Italian designer's version of hi-
tech telephone booths or, possibly, portable shower stalls.
The whole thing feels completely wrong to Veronica.
VERONICA
Listen, maybe this is a bad idea.
BRUNDLE
(JOKING)
5.
Too late. You’ve already seen it. I 
can’t let you leave here alive.
VERONICA
I haven’t seen anything.
Brundle carefully points out the glass booths.
BRUNDLE
Those.
VERONICA
Designer phone booths. Very cute. 
I’ll bet you’ve got a really neat 
jukebox in here somewhere, too. 
Over there, maybe?
She points to a huge shape in a corner covered by a 
tarpaulin.
BRUNDLE
No, that’s the prototype of these. 
First one I had made. It works, but 
it’s clunky.
Brundle pulls a blue bathrobe being used as an impromptu dust 
cover off an extremely serious-looking control­ module 
complete with computer console and monitor. The information 
storage system is all laser disc. The module is on wheels, 
but is plugged into a heavy-duty wiring loom at the base of 
one of the pillars.
Brundle flips a couple of switches. Lights come on. The 
monitor flickers to life. Very bright white interior lights 
also come on in the two booths.
BRUNDLE
I call them telepods. They’re 
controlled by this.
VERONICA
(SARCASTIC)
Thank God for that.
Veronica takes a careful look at Brundle.
VERONICA
You’re very eccentric.
BRUNDLE
(GENUINELY PLEASED)
You think so? That would be great. 
I’ve always considered myself 
invisibly middle-class.
6.
VERONICA
I don’t think you should worry 
about it. OK. So what do they do? 
The phone booths?
BRUNDLE
Telepods.
(PAUSE)
All right. As the magician says, 
'Give me something personal, an 
item of clothing or jewelry, 
something uniquely you.'
VERONICA
You’re joking.
BRUNDLE
(INGENUOUS)
No, I'm serious.
Veronica studies him once again. Yes, he’s serious.
VERONICA
OK. Here goes.
Veronica hikes up her skirt and slips off her panties -an 
impulsive act rather than a calculated one. She holds them 
out to Brundle. They’re lacy and pretty. Brundle is shocked.
BRUNDLE
Ah... well...
VERONICA
I don’t wear jewelry.
BRUNDLE
Yeah. OK.
He takes the panties, gingerly.
BRUNDLE
Nice.
VERONICA
Thanks.
Brundle walks over to the nearest telepod and presses a 
button on the doorframe. The door unlatches with a click.
Brundle carefully places the panties on the floor of the 
telepod, then closes the door again.
7.
Brundle returns to the computer, sits down on an old steno 
chair, and starts to click away at the computer keys. 
Veronica looks over his shoulder.
The screen fills with techno-babble. This soon makes way for 
a three-dimensional graphic of Veronica’s panties which 
rotates on the screen. A DATA LIST appears in the corner of 
the screen outlining the panties’ vital statistics - weight, 
dimensions, density, molecular configuration, etc.
Satisfied, Brundle smiles, presses the ACCEPT button, and 
points to the first telepod.
BRUNDLE
Watch.
The first thing that happens is that the automatic door­ latch 
on the outside of the telepod slides shut. The latch is 
substantial, even massive, suggesting that IT WOULD NOT BE A 
GOOD THING FOR THE DOOR TO OPEN ACCIDENTALLY.
Now, as Veronica watches, the PANTIES BEGIN TO DISINTEGRATE 
in the telepod. It’s almost as though we can
see the atoms breaking off from the cloth itself and begin to 
float, swirl, swarm about in the bright cold light of the 
telepod. In moments, there is nothing left of the panties.
The telepod lights flash once, then go out.
Brundle turns proudly to Veronica.
BRUNDLE
Well?
VERONICA
Great. The world’s largest 
microwave oven. I’m glad I didn’t 
give you my Rolex.
BRUNDLE
No, no - you’re missing the point. 
Look.
Brundle points to the screen. The words TELEPORTATION 
SUCCESSFUL are flashing on and off.
VERONICA
(CONFUSED)
Teleportation?
Brundle gets up and takes Veronica by the hand.
BRUNDLE
8.
Now come with me.
Brundle marches Veronica across the room to the second 
telepod. Inside the telepod are her panties.
VERONICA
Wait a minute. Is that a hologram? 
Where are my panties?
Brundle press the door button and the door to the second 
telepod pops open.
BRUNDLE
That’s them. The real ones. Go 
ahead. Pick them up.
Veronica hesitates a beat, then reaches into the telepod and 
picks up her panties. She crumples them in her hand. They 
feel the same.
BRUNDLE
(NIGHTCLUB MAGICIAN 
VOICE)
Examine them carefully for 
authenticity. Make sure nothing has 
been lost in translation.
Veronica looks at the label, the lace trim. It all checks 
out.
VERONICA
I don’t think I get it. What 
happened?
BRUNDLE
You get it, all right. You just 
can’t handle it. Your panties have 
just been teleported from one pod 
to another. Disintegrated there, 
and reintegrated there. Sort of. 
It’ll change the world as we know 
it, right? Want me to autograph 
them?
VERONICA
This is incredible. How have you 
managed to keep this quiet? How 
could you do this alone?
BRUNDLE
9.
I don’t work alone. There’s a lot 
of stuff in there I don’t even 
understand. I’m really a systems-
management man. I farm bits and 
pieces of this stuff out to guys 
who are much more brilliant than I 
am. But none of them knows what the 
project really is. I say - build me 
a laser this, design me a molecular 
analyzer that - and they do. I just 
stick ’em together.
VERONICA
And the money? Bartok Science 
Industries finances this?
BRUNDLE
They leave me alone. I’m not 
expensive. They know they’ll end up 
owning it all, whatever it is.
VERONICA
You haven’t told them?
BRUNDLE
When I’m ready.
An insistent little beep begins to sound from somewhere under 
Veronica’s chic padded jacket. She drops the panties onto a 
coffee table, fumbles around in her jacket and pulls out a 
small tape recorder from an inner pocket.
Brundle is stunned: she’s been taping him.
BRUNDLE
Oh, no! Not that!
Veronica deftly flips over the cassette, sets the machine on 
RECORD, and drops it back into the pocket.
VERONICA
Why not? You want me to get the 
quotes right, don't you?
BRUNDLE
Don't do it. If this gets out now, 
it'll be a disaster.
VERONICA
Oh, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
BRUNDLE
But I'm not exaggerating...
10.
VERONICA
(SUDDENLY ANGRY)
What do you think I'm doing here, 
anyway? Don't give me that naïve 
bullshit. I'm a journalist. I was 
sent to that party by PARTICLE 
Magazine. You knew that.
BRUNDLE
But I thought this was... you know, 
personal. I wouldn't tell any of 
this stuff to a journalist.
VERONICA
But you did tell this stuff to a 
journalist. And you know what? I 
think you did it intentionally. I 
think you want me to tell the world 
about this. You just haven’t 
admitted it to yourself.
(SHE HEADS FOR THE DOOR)
Listen - it’s been real.
Veronica’s almost out the door. She obviously has no 
intention of hanging around to discuss it. Brundle picks up 
her panties from the coffee table.
BRUNDLE
(WITH RISING ANGER)
Hey - you forgot something!
Veronica pauses, turns. Brundle balls up the panties and 
throws them at her. They unfold in midair and flop harmlessly 
on the floor between them.
Veronica shrugs and smiles a "What can I do?" kind of smile. 
She leaves. Brundle slides the door closed after her with a 
slam.
EXT. MONOLITH PUBLISHING BUILDING - MORNING

Establishing shot of sleeko modern office building.
INT. PARTICLE MAGAZINE EDITORIAL OFFICES - MORNING

11.
We are in the office of STATHIS BORANS, the Editor-in-Chief 
of PARTICLE Magazine. The office itself oozes power and 
influence - the office of a starmaker in the arcane world of 
modern science. Stathis himself seems a bit more like the 
editor of a self-consciously chic New York glossy, say VANITY 
FAIR. He wears small, round, horn­ rimmed glasses and 
immaculate classic clothes. Despite his stylistic 
pretensions, however, his background is solidly scientific, 
and the walls are covered with his degrees, both honorary and 
hard-science.
Veronica is draped comfortably over an art-deco couch - 
obviously very much at home. They are listening to her tape.
VERONICA (ON TAPE)
You just haven’t admitted it to 
yourself.
(PAUSE)
Listen - it's been real.
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
Hey... you forgot something!
Veronica flicks off the tape recorder.
VERONICA
That’s it. What do you think?
STATHIS
I think you’re an opportunistic 
slut.
VERONICA
(IGNORING THE COMMENT)
What do you think about 
teleportation?
STATHIS
It’s a joke.
VERONICA
What?
STATHIS
He’s conning you. He’s doing an old 
nightclub routine. The two 
cabinets. And you fell for it.
VERONICA
Hey, wait a minute...
STATHIS
Are we having lunch?
12.
VERONICA
Listen, that was no nightclub 
routine.
The intercom buzzes.
STATHIS
(PICKING UP PHONE)
Yes?
(PAUSE)
Sure. Send him in.
Stathis hangs up.
STATHIS
You must have made an impression.
VERONICA
What do you mean?
STATHIS
Your magician has followed you 
here.
A young woman wearing a brisk business suit shows Brundle in. 
Stathis smiles a professional smile and extends his hand.
STATHIS
Stathis Borans. I’m the editor of 
PARTICLE Magazine.. Nice to meet 
you.
BRUNDLE
Uh... Seth Brundle.
STATHIS
(KNOWINGLY)
Oh, I know who you are.
Brundle is about to ask "How?” but doesn’t get the chance.
STATHIS
Listen... why don’t you two use my 
office? I’ve got to run.
(TO BRUNDLE)
If you plan to make anything 
disappear, let me know. I have an 
assistant editor who’s outlived his 
usefulness.
Stathis leaves.
BRUNDLE
You haven’t wasted any time.
13.
VERONICA
I’m not getting any younger.
BRUNDLE
I take it he wasn’t too impressed 
by your tape.
VERONICA
(PACKING UP TAPE MACHINE)
He thinks you’re a con man.
BRUNDLE
(BRIGHTENING)
Excellent!
VERONICA
Yeah? Well, let’s see what the 
people at Omni think about it.
BRUNDLE
Hold on, hold on. Look. I’ve come 
here to say two magic words to you.
She stops at the door.
VERONICA
Yeah?
BRUNDLE
Cheese-burger.
Brundle says these words as though they are indeed magical, 
irresistible. Veronica shakes her head and laughs. For her, 
it’s Brundle himself who’s rapidly becoming irresistible.
INT. EDITORIAL OFFICES. HALLWAY - MORNING

Veronica leaves with Brundle. They are showing signs of 
liking each other. Stathis watches them through the glass 
wall of the conference room. His eyes are laser bright.
He is not smiling. He picks up the phone.
STATHIS
Renee? Get me everything you’ve got 
on Seth Brundle. Yeah. He’s with 
Bartok. Yeah - their stable of 
geniuses. He was part of their dog 
and pony show two days ago. Yeah. 
But I mean, everything, including 
personal. Dig deep, darling. 
Thanks.

INT. MACDONALDSESQUE RESTAURANT - DAY

CU Burgers sliding down a ramp in assembly-line style.
CU cheese slices being slapped onto each burger by machine.
Brundle is taking Veronica out to lunch.
VERONICA
You always eat here?
BRUNDLE
I hate surprises. Scientists love 
things to be repeatable. Every time 
you walk in, it’s exactly the same 
thing. I love it. Makes me feel 
secure.
Veronica takes a bite of her burger. It is obvious that she 
is used to better things.
VERONICA
It’s a high price to pay for 
security.
BRUNDLE
Let’s talk turkey.
Veronica is amused at Brundle’s turn of phrase. He hasn't 
been on the streets since he was eight years old.
VERONICA
Sure. Turkey.
BRUNDLE
You were right. I’ve been working 
alone too long. I have a very 
strong urge to talk about what I'm 
doing. But still... if this gets 
out now, it'll kill me. The Bartok 
people will kill me, my colleagues 
will kill me. It's not ready yet.
VERONICA
Seems to work OK.
BRUNDLE
No. Something important is missing.
VERONICA
Yeah?
BRUNDLE
(HE WON'T TALK)
15.
Yeah.
VERONICA
"Yeah” what?
BRUNDLE
(HE DECIDES TO TALK)
I can only teleport inanimate 
objects. Dead things.
VERONICA
Are you criticizing my taste in 
underwear?
BRUNDLE
(BRIGHTENING)
No! I love your taste in underwear!
VERONICA
What happens when you try to 
teleport living things?
BRUNDLE
(MAKES A FACE, SHAKES HIS 
HEAD)
Not while we’re eating.
VERONICA
(LAUGHS, INDICATES 
BURGER)
It can’t be worse than this.
(PAUSE)
You’re not doing a very good job of 
convincing me. I think the world 
should know about it now, and I 
think I should be the one to tell 
it.
BRUNDLE
How about half of that?
VERONICA
What do you mean?
BRUNDLE
You should tell it, but not yet. 
Look, what have you got so far?
VERONICA
Just enough to make you nervous.
BRUNDLE
16.
Why not get more? Let me become 
your major project. I’m talking 
about a book, not a magazine 
article. Follow me and my work day 
by day, in as much detail as you 
can stand. I don’t have a life - so 
there’s nothing for you to 
interfere with. Research the 
background. Cover the process.
(PAUSE)
You could even move in with me if 
you wanted to. I mean... you know, 
in a professional context.
VERONICA
Sure. I know.
BRUNDLE
(WRITING HER DUST-COVER 
BLURB)
"The complete record of the most 
earth­ shattering invention ever. 
The one that ended all concepts of 
transport, of time and space, of 
borders and frontiers.”
(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
And your book will end with me 
transporting myself fifteen feet 
through space, from one telepod to 
another. That’s what’s really 
missing. Wait for me that long.
Veronica has mustard on her upper lip and her eyes are 
bright. Brundle is pushing the right buttons.
INT. VERONICA’S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Veronica opens the door to her apartment - one of those 
places in which something stylish has been done with not 
really very much. As she dumps the day’s accumulated gear 
onto a floppy couch, she hears the shower going in the 
bathroom.
INT. VERONICA’S BATHROOM - DAY
11

Veronica cautiously approaches the bathroom. The door is 
open. Veronica approaches the shower and, taking a deep 
breath, pulls aside the shower curtain. Stathis is calmly 
taking a shower.
VERONICA
What are you doing in my apartment?
17.
STATHIS
I happened to be in the 
neighborhood, felt a bit scummy. 
Rough day.
Veronica pulls the shower curtain back into place in disgust 
and slams the bathroom door on the way out.
INT. VERONICA’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Veronica is drinking coffee and sorting through some papers 
when Stathis walks into the room, fully dressed but still 
toweling off his hair.
STATHIS
No coffee for me?
VERONICA
As far as I’m concerned, you’re not 
here.
STATHIS
The invisible man.
VERONICA
How did you get in?
STATHIS
I still have a key. You gave it to 
me, remember?
VERONICA
I knew I should have changed the 
locks.
STATHIS
I knew you wouldn’t.
VERONICA
Yeah?
STATHIS
Yeah. That’s because, 
unconsciously, you want me to come 
back to you, move in again.
VERONICA
No. That’s because, very 
consciously, I’m lazy and 
disorganized.
STATHIS
18.
You new playmate is an interesting 
guy.
VERONICA
What playmate?
STATHIS
The nightclub act. Brundle.
VERONICA
Yeah?
STATHIS
Yeah, I was wrong. He’s really very 
brilliant. He was the leader of the 
F32 team. Remember that? An inch 
away from the Nobel Prize for 
physics. He was only twenty at the 
time.
VERONICA
Well, he acts like he’s sixteen 
right now.
(PAUSE)
I'm not sure I'm going to do 
Brundle. I'm still considering the 
Psychology Today gig.
STATHIS
(SUSPICIOUS)
That's not like you.
VERONICA
(WRY)
How would you know? We only lived 
together for two years. You were 
just beginning to not ice me when 
we split up.
STATHIS
Now that is like you.
VERONICA
Are you getting out or am I?
STATHIS
(AMIABLE)
I'll go. I've got to put this issue 
to bed. Shall I come back later?
VERONICA
No.
(HOLDS OUT HER HAND)
Key.

STATHIS
I'll keep it, for old time’s sake. 
You want to keep me out, you change 
the locks.
He leaves.
INT. BRUNDLE’S LAB - NIGHT

13
On a video monitor, we are close on a small monkey, the 
monkey is in the sending telepod. We pop back to a general 
view of Brundle1s lab. He is, indeed, about to transmit a 
monkey and is hard at work at his computer keyboard.
Veronica is also hard at work.
She’s got the entire place wired now - videotape, still 
cameras, sound tapes. Tapes recording his computer screens. 
She’s trying to keep track of everything from behind a small 
bank of video monitors stacked on a table.
Brundle plays the keyboard like Glenn Gould at his most 
eccentric - he mutters, mumbles, sings to himself.
Finally, he sits back in satisfaction and presses the ACCEPT 
button.
CU the MASSIVE TELEPOD DOOR LATCH as it slides shut.
The control monitor diagrams the monkey, the outlined figure 
on the screen duplicating the movement of its real-life 
counterpart inside the transmitter. The animals vital 
satisfies are calculated and appear. Then...
The light goes on in the transmitter, lancing through the ape 
who is frozen in fear. The animal disintegrates.
Brundle dances up from the keyboard and runs over to the 
receiving telepod. As he peers through the window, SOMETHING, 
presumably the monkey’s body, lurches with a thump against 
the window. A RED SPLOTCH smears across the glass pane. From 
inside the chamber comes a sickening, tormented thrashing 
sound as the bloody, misshapen lump - a monkey turned inside 
out - splatters itself all over the glass of the telepod.
Veronica turns away from the spectacle, sickened. Brundle is 
devastated.
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
Brundle, in CU on monitor and in life. Brundle’s expression 
says "despair." We hear Veronica’s voice off-camera as she 
interviews him.
20.
VERONICA (OC)
We’ve got to do this, Brundle. Talk 
to the tapes. Get in the habit. The 
world will want to know what you’re 
thinking.
BRUNDLE
Fuck! Is what I’m thinking.
VERONICA (OC)
Good. The world will want to know 
that. What else? Why didn’t it 
work?
BRUNDLE
I think it turned the monkey inside 
out.
VERONICA (OC)
Why?
BRUNDLE
It can’t deal with flesh, with 
living things. It only seems to 
work with inanimate objects. 
Nothing that’s alive.
(THOUGHTFUL PAUSE)
It must be my fault.
VERONICA
Why?
BRUNDLE
Computers are dumb. They only know 
what you tell them. I must not know 
enough about the flesh myself. 
Gonna have to learn.
(HEAVY, RAGGED SIGH)
I don’t want to talk now.
INT. LAB. BEDROOM AREA - NIGHT

Brundle lies on his mattress, despondent. Veronica sits 
nearby.
VERONICA
Do you ever change your clothes?
BRUNDLE
Huh?
VERONICA
21.
Your clothes. You’re always wearing 
the same clothes.
BRUNDLE
No... these are clean. I change my 
clothes every day.
Veronica gets up and goes over to his free-standing closet. 
She opens the canvas door. Inside are neatly hung five 
versions of exactly the same clothes - sweater, pants, etc.
VERONICA
Five sets of exactly the same 
clothes?
BRUNDLE
I learned it from Einstein.
VERONICA
Repeatability?
BRUNDLE
Yeah. This way, I don’t have to 
expend any thought on what I’m 
going to wear. I just grab the next 
set on the rack.
Veronica lets the canvas door of the closet swing closed and 
drifts back to Brundle.
VERONICA
I bought some steaks. Can I make 
you one?
BRUNDLE
We could go out
VERONICA
Cheese-burgers?
BRUNDLE
(NOW SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT 
IT)
Well, I...
(SHRUGS)
We don’t have to go there...
Veronica gets on the mattress with him..
VERONICA
You’re very cute.
BRUNDLE
(NERVOUS)
22.
Am I?
VERONICA
Uh-huh.
She runs a finger over his lips. He tries to talk while she 
does this.
BRUNDLE
I... I think you’re very beautiful.
Veronica’s finger ends up stuck in one corner of his mouth. 
She laughs.
Veronica bends close to Brundle and kisses him full on the 
lips. It makes Brundle very nervous.
Brundle tries top roll elegantly out from under Veronica’s 
advance but instead rolls half off the mattress and onto 
something sharp which has been lying on the floor. He yelps 
in pain.
BRUNDLE
Ouch!
Brundle detaches himself from Veronica.
VERONICA
What happened?
BRUNDLE
I rolled onto something sharp. Take 
a look.
Brundle turns his back to Veronica. Stuck to his back at the 
end of three tiny streaks of blood staining through his shirt 
is an old circuit board.
VERONICA
Oh, God. Something’s stuck to your 
back!
BRUNDLE
(COOL)
Well, pull it off.
Veronica is - perhaps surprisingly -squeamish. She grimaces 
as she pulls the board away. Three sharp metal connectors are 
the culprits. She shows it to Brundle.
BRUNDLE
Oh, yeah. I was wondering what 
happened to this.
23.
Brundle feels for the scratches and brings back blood on his 
finger tips.
VERONICA
We’d better take a look.
Veronica begins to unbutton Brundle’s shirt.
BRUNDLE
(NERVOUS)
Uh... I can do that.
Veronica brushes his hands away.
VERONICA
(SEDUCTIVELY)
No, you’ve lost some blood. Better 
let me do it.
Veronica takes Brundle’s shirt off, caressing his shoulders 
as she does it. There are three long, deep scratches high on 
his back near the shoulder blade. Each scratch ends with a 
puncture mark.
VERONICA
Have you got any disinfectant?
Brundle hands her a nearby dusty old glass of Scotch.
BRUNDLE
This oughta do the trick.
Veronica dabs it on the scratches with her fingers.
Brundle gasps at the sharpness. Veronica gives his shoulder a 
gentle bite.
BRUNDLE
Ah, please. No more pain.
VERONICA
Sorry. I just suddenly wanted to 
eat you up. You know - that’s why 
old ladies pinch baby cheeks. It’s 
the flesh, it makes them crazy.
BRUNDLE
(DISTRACTED)
Uh-huh. The flesh. Yes. Wanna try 
an experiment?
VERONICA
(EXCITED)
Sure.
24.
To her consternation, Brundle jumps out of bed and heads for 
the kitchen.
BRUNDLE
Let’s make a steak.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LAB. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT

CU raw steak as it is cut into two halves.
We pop back to see Brundle at work in the kitchen.
MONTAGE SEQUENCE
as Brundle puts one half of the steak through the teleporter 
on a white plate, and keeps the other half on a brown plate.
Brundle takes the teleported half out of the receiver and 
begins to cook each half in a pan, without seasoning. He is 
careful to remember which half is which.
Brundle pulls the steak halves off the stove.
Brundle places the teleported half of the steak on a table in 
front of Veronica.
END OF MONTAGE SEQUENCE
BRUNDLE
OK. Eat this. I need an objective 
opinion.
VERONICA
Are you serious? A monkey just came 
apart in that booth.
BRUNDLE
Eat!
Veronica takes a bite of the steak.
VERONICA
Hmph.
BRUNDLE
So?
VERONICA
It tastes - funny.
BRUNDLE
25.
Funny how?
VERONICA
It tastes - synthetic.
BRUNDLE
Now try this half.
She takes a bit e of the non-teleported half.
VERONICA
Ok. It could use some finesse, 
but... it tastes like a steak. What 
have we proved?
Brundle begins to free-associate with a passion.
BRUNDLE
Computers are dumb. They have no 
poetry. They do exactly what you 
tell them to do. Life is poetry. 
Even a good steak is poetry. The 
computer is giving us its 
interpretation of a steak. It’s 
rethinking it for us, translating 
it rather than reproducing it. And 
something is getting lost in the 
translation.
VERONICA
Me. I'm lost.
BRUNDLE
The ghost in the machine. The life 
essence. Soul. Yeah. So. I know 
what you’re gonna say. You’re gonna 
say, "But a steak is dead.” Sure, a 
steak is dead - but it’s dead life!
VERONICA
I don’t think I was going to say 
that.
Brundle gets up and starts to back out of the kitchen, headed 
more or less for the lab’s work area.
BRUNDLE
(DISAPPEARING AROUND THE 
CORNER)
26.
It's what you've already said. It's 
the flesh. It should make the 
machine crazy, just like those old 
ladies pinching babies. But it 
doesn't, not yet. I haven't taught 
the machine how to be made crazy by 
the flesh, the poetry, the steak. 
I'm going to start teaching it now.
VERONICA
(CALLING AFTER HIM)
What are you going to do, read it 
"Naked Lunch?"
But Brundle is already gone. The sound of the keyboard 
clacking away madly floats back to Veronica from the lab work 
area. She shrugs and starts to finish off the good half of 
the steak.
EXT. LAB WAREHOUSE - MORNING

Veronica leaves the lab and walks down the street. She walks 
past a nondescript car out of which rises Stathis, who is 
unshaven, half-asleep, lurking like a common maniac. He's 
obviously been there all night.
Veronica gets into her car and starts it. Stathis starts his 
and follows her down the street.
EXT. MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - MORNING

Veronica goes into the store. Stathis waits a beat, then gets 
out of his car and follows her in.
INT. MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - MORNING

Stathis watches her shop - for a man. It’s making him crazy. 
He no longer looks cool and powerful, just jealous and 
unbalanced.
Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Stathis intercepts her 
amongst the clothes racks just as she’s picked a jacket out 
for Brundle.
STATHIS
I should have known it!
VERONICA
(SHOCKED)
What are you doing here? I hate 
this!
27.
STATHIS
I followed you. Psychology Today, 
my ass. You stayed with Brundle all 
night. Why didn’t I believe you? I 
wonder.
Stathis grabs the jacket out of her hand and holds it up to 
himself.
STATHIS
Yeah, I think he’d look great in 
this, don’t you? I mean, for your 
TIME magazine cover you’ve gotta 
look good.
VERONICA
Listen Stath. Don’t you get it? I’m 
finally onto something that’s big. 
Huge.
STATHIS
Oh yeah? His cock?
VERONICA
Crude, Stath. Very crude.
Stathis throws the jacket at her - rather viciously.
STATHIS
It's too perfect to believe! You’re 
a goddess. I give thanks to you for 
making my most paranoid fantasies 
come true!
He gets on his knees right in the middle of the aisle and 
bows down to her. Shoppers and clerks try to ignore them, 
hoping it will all just go away soon.
VERONICA
(FURIOUS)
I don’t have to report to you, you 
creep!
She turns and starts to walk away.
Stathis struggles to his feet.
STATHIS
(PATHETIC, GENUINELY 
HURT)
Ronnie! You’ve got to talk tome!
VERONICA
28.
I don’t have to do anything! We’re 
finished, remember? I’ll spend the 
night anywhere I damn well please!
She stomps over to the cash, where there is a pile of men's 
clothes already assembled.
VERONICA
(INDICATING JACKET)
I’ll take this too.
CLERK
Certainly.
Stathis watches from a distance, glowering.

CLOSE-UP OF RECEIVER
The screen is filled with GLOWING LIGHT. AS THE CAMERA PULLS 
BACK, we realize it's the light of the receiver chamber.
INTERCUTTING SHOTS...as the reintegration process completes 
its cycle.
ON BRUNDLE...as he bites his nails, nervously waiting for the 
1ight to go out.
ON VERONICA... behind the stack of video monitors, recording 
it all.
ON COMPUTER MONITOR...there is a computerized diagram of 
something forming...
ON RECEIVING CHAMBER DOOR...inside the same shape forming in 
the diagram is forming here. It is some sort of PRIMATE.
ON MONITOR...the diagram is filling out more. We hear the 
machine shut off and the reflected light from the receiver 
disappears. The diagram of the ape starts to move, reflecting 
the movements of the actual subject in the telepod. Its 
statistics are also calculated on screen.
ON RECEIVER DOOR...as Brundle opens it. Inside a SMALL MONKEY 
sits, apparently healthy, happy, and totally whole.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Brundle opens the receiver and the monkey playfully scrambles 
up his arm, clinging to his neck. Brundle smiles and strokes 
him.
29.
Making a cursory inspection of the monkey, Brundle takes it 
over to a table and deposits it in its CAGE. It chatters at 
him contentedly.
Brundle looks up into the lens of the nearest camera. He can 
barely suppress his pride and excitement.
BRUNDLE
I think it’s time for champagne!
Veronica flicks off the monitors and comes out from behind 
the stack to join Brundle.
VERONICA
(EXCITED)
Oh, God, Brundle! It’s really 
happened! You did it! And all 
because you get car sick!
BRUNDLE
(EXUBERANT)
Yeah, I did it! I really...
(CONFUSED)
Car sick?
VERONICA
I finally figured it out. You came 
up with this so you wouldn’t have 
to travel in my car.
They laugh, they kiss. We notice that Brundle is wearing new 
clothes, including the jacket that Stathis saw Veronica 
buying in the store.
Brundle takes the bottle of champagne waiting in its cooler 
and struggles to pop the cork. He’s not really very good at 
it. Veronica gently takes over and does it for him while they 
talk.
VERONICA
What next?
BRUNDLE
I send the monkey out for tests, 
see if he’s really OK.
VERONICA
How long will that take?
BRUNDLE
Could be weeks. Why?
VERONICA
30.
I was thinking - we could take a 
holiday.
BRUNDLE
We could?
VERONICA
(POPPING THE CHAMPAGNE 
CORK)
Yeah. Like an old married couple. 
You know - the old man’s got a 
coupla weeks off, so they go to 
Florida, someplace warm.
BRUNDLE
Just you and me?
VERONICA
Why, is there somebody else you 
want to bring along?
BRUNDLE
No, no... it's just... is this a 
romance we’re having? Is that what 
it is?
Veronica laughs and hugs him.
VERONICA
Could be a romance.
She’s about to pour the champagne when she spots a manila 
envelope on the table. It has the PARTICLE Magazine logo 
stamped on it, and clipped to it is a piece of expensive 
PARTICLE notepaper which says "From the Desk of Stathis 
Borans, Editor, PARTICLE Magazine." In handwriting, it says: 
"Thought you’d like to see this before it went to the 
printer. All my love, Stath.”
VERONICA
What’s that?
BRUNDLE
Somebody slipped it under the door. 
Hand delivered - there’s no 
postage.
Veronica hands the champagne bottle to Brundle and rips open 
the envelope. It’s a mockup of the next issue of PARTICLE. On 
the cover is Brundle - in his new jacket (artists’s 
rendering). He’s been made to look a little crazed.
31.
Under his photo it says, TELEPORTATION A REALITY? SETH 
BRUNDLE -Youthful Father of a New Age. In the background are 
sketched two telepods. The sketch of the telepods is all 
wrong - Stathis hasn’t actually seen the telepods - but the 
message is clear: Stathis intends to blow the entire deal.
VERONICA
Shit!
BRUNDLE
What is it?
Veronica slips the magazine back into the envelope.
VERONICA
It’s...uh... just personal 
bullshit...
BRUNDLE
I thought old married couples 
shared all their personal bullshit. 
That’s how they stayed old and 
married.
VERONICA
(KISSES HIM WITH REAL 
TENDERNESS)
Don’t rush it, Brundle, and it’ll 
all happen. I’ve got to go out for 
a few hours.
BRUNDLE
But... right now? The champagne...
VERONICA
Just a few hours. I've still got 
the residue of another life, you 
know? I gotta scrape it off my shoe 
and get rid of it for once and for 
all.
Veronica leaves.
Brundle sighs and pours himself a glass of champagne.

The offices are all but deserted. A janitor is polishing the 
floors. Veronica walks in on Stathis and throws the magazine 
mockup on his desk.
VERONICA
What’s this supposed to mean?
STATHIS
It means that I’m your editor and 
I’m shaping your material into a 
story.
VERONICA
You’re the one who told me there 
was no story. You said Brundle was 
a con man.
STATHIS
I've decided to trust your 
journalistic instincts.
VERONICA
Thanks a lot. But this isn't your 
story. It's mine.
STATHIS
Says who? I sent you to the Bartok 
party to see what you could find. 
Your discovery is my discovery.
VERONICA
Don't be a bastard.
STATHIS
Don't be a bitch.
VERONICA
You don't have anything.
STATHIS
I have your tape. I have a lot of 
background on Brundle. He's been 
working on this thing for six 
years. There's material out there 
to find if you dig deep. I dug 
deep. Enough to unearth a cover 
story.
VERONICA
I'll sue you. I'll get an 
injunction!
STATHIS
33.
Great! Let's play. But that's my 
game. You know that.
Veronica flops into a chair with a big sigh. She's going to 
have to negotiate.
VERONICA
What do you want from me?
STATHIS
I care about you and I worry about 
you. I want to know what’s going 
on. Everything.
VERONICA
I don’t want you to know 
everything.
STATHIS
(SUDDENLY FRUSTRATED AND 
ANGRY)
You really like this guy. You’re 
fucking him. I hate it!
VERONICA
Yeah, I like him. He’s funny.
STATHIS
You told me I was funny.
VERONICA
You were funny.
STATHIS
Not any more, huh?
VERONICA
You’re scaring me.
STATHIS
(YELLING LIKE A 
PSYCHOTIC)
I’m not a psychotic! I won’t hurt 
you!
VERONICA
Your gravity scares me.
STATHIS
I love you. Is that what you mean?
VERONICA
34.
You’re in pain because of me. That 
scares me. I really don’t want that 
power. I wish you would take it 
back.
STATHIS
I wish I could. What do we do now?
VERONICA
Are you gonna wreck me with this 
Brundle thing?
STATHIS
You really think it's the Pulitzer 
Prize for little Ronnie Quaife, do 
you?
VERONICA
Stath! It's teleportation! It’s one 
of the great dreams - and it's on 
the verge of coming true! No more 
planes, trains, ships, cars, 
roads... Everything to do with 
transportation will become 
obsolete! And I'm right there in 
the middle of it - the only 
recorder of the event from the 
inside out!
STATHIS
OK. OK. Look - just keep me 
informed, all right? As a friend, 
as a professional confidante. And 
if you need any help, you come to 
me.
VERONICA
That's all?
STATHIS
I don't want you to disappear from 
my life.
They kiss, delicately - a friendly kiss.
VERONICA
OK.
STATHIS
(PAUSE)
What about sex? I'm not saying love 
or affection. Just stress-relieving 
sex, you and me.
35.
Veronica laughs, stands up and heads for the door.
VERONICA
(LAUGHING)
You're disgusting - as always.
STATHIS
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
INT. LAB - NIGHT

Brundle is drinking the champagne himself. He has let the 
monkey roam free and is playing with it. He’s a little drunk.
BRUNDLE
(TO MONKEY)
"From the desk of Stathis Borans.” 
Sure. How about, "Under the desk of 
Stathis Borans." Is that where she 
is right now? Right. It’s the 
Ronnie game, and I’m catching on 
fast.
The monkey chatters amiably. A fly buzzes around its face. 
Brundle brushes it away.
BRUNDLE
(TO MONKEY)
I never meant to kill your brother, 
you know. It was a mistake. 
Manslaughter but not homicide. As 
the general said, "There’s nothing 
I’d ask you to do that I wouldn’t 
do myself, boys. You know that."
This gives him an idea.
BRUNDLE
Hey, you’re all right. I’m looking 
at you, and I can tell you’re OK. 
So - what are we waiting for? Let’s 
do it?
He takes a hefty slug of champagne, then takes off his 
clothes.
BRUNDLE
"All my love," huh? That means he’s 
her lover, doesn't it? "From the 
desk of your lover, Stathis 
Borans."
36.
Brundle rises and walks up to the transmitter, examining it. 
He chews on a fingernail for a moment, then opens the door.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Brundle moves to each of the VIDEO CAMERAS and turns them on.
He moves to the control board. He fingers the TIMER 
nervously, hesitating...he glances at the transmitter, then 
back at the timer.
The FLY buzzes about Brundle’s head. Brundle distractedly 
brushes the insect away.
ON FLY
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE FLY as it alights on the outside of 
the transmitter door.
ON BRUNDLE
Resets his empty champagne glass down on a table, still 
gazing at the control panel timer. He glances once more at 
the transmitter, then, heaving a deep sigh, turns once more 
to the timer, resolved to action.
CLOSE ON BRUNDLE’S HAND
As his fingers set the timer. A DIGITAL READOUT displays: 
”00:20”...TWENTY SECONDS, then: ”00:19”.
ON TRANSMITTER TELEPOD
Brundle quickly enters it and closes the door. THE CAMERA 
MOVES IN CLOSE ON THE GLASS WINDOW OF THE TRANSMITTER DOOR. 
THERE WE SEE CRAWLING ACROSS THE PANE... THE FLY — BUT NOW ON 
THE INSIDE!
INTERCUTTING SHOTS...as the Transmission process commences.
ON TIMER...the display readout has moved to "00:08.”
ON MASSIVE TELEPOD DOOR LATCH...as it slides shut with great 
finality.
ON BRUNDLE...1ittle droplets of sweat bead his brow as he 
stares down at the floor of the chamber...waiting...
ON FLY...crawling in the corner of the glass door, quite 
unnoticed by Brundle.
ON TIMER...”00:04"
37.
ON MONKEY... outside the door of the transmitter, pawing at 
it, watching Brundle inside -a strange reversal of the usual 
routine.
ON BRUNDLE... noticing the monkey outside. He manages a 
nervous smile.
ON VIDEO EYEPIECE MONITOR... as it dispassionately records 
everything.
ON FLY... its buzzing drowned out by the hum of machinery.
ON TIMER...as it goes from "00:01 to "00:00".
ON BRUNDLE...waiting...
ON MONITOR...Brundle’s outline is diagrammed, his vital 
statistics computed down to the minutest fraction. But not 
only Brundle is charted on the monitor -- so is the fly!
ON FLY...crawling along the glass.
ON BRUNDLE...anxious, sweat pouring from his brow.
ON MONKEY... cavorting outside the door.
ON BRUNDLE'S EYES...seen only for an instant, before the 
ENTIRE SCREEN is filled with BRILLIANT LIGHT.
ON MONKEY... as it screeches and runs in terror.
ON TRANSMITTER TELEPOD...its interior bathed in light, 
Brundle fading from view...
ON MONITOR...Brundle’s out line becomes fragmented. THE FLY 
has already disappeared!
ON TRANSMITTER TELEPOD...The 1ight goes off, the chamber is 
empty. There is a FLASH OF LIGHT in another part of the room.
ON RECEIVER...now full of light, the reintegration process 
has commenced. Brundle begins to re-form.
ON MONITOR...duplicating Brundle’s reintegration in the 
receiver. A human outline fragmentedly appears.
ON BRUNDLE...as the light shuts off abruptly. He shakes 
himself as though coming out of a daze.
Brundle opens the receiver door and steps out.
THE CAMERA PANS PAST BRUNDLE TO THE INTERIOR OF THE GLASS 
WINDOW -- BUT THERE IS NOTHING THERE!
38.
Brundle looks around for his audience. He sees the monkey 
cowering on the sofa. Brundle smiles at it triumphantly.
BRUNDLE
Now you tell me - am I different 
somehow? Is it live, or is it 
Memorex?
(LAUGHS, PERHAPS A LITTLE 
TOO GIDDY)
Too bad you missed it, Ronnie. Too 
bad.
In a mood of righteous anger, Brundle grabs the champagne 
bottle and finishes off the champagne.

I'm sorry.

You could have killed yourself! 
You’re like a little pouty kid. I

What are you talking about?

VERONICA
(INCREDULOUS)
That's why you were upset?
BRUNDLE
I got jealous.
VERONICA
Oh, God.
(PAUSE)
But... you don't have to be 
jealous. He’s an old boyfriend. He 
was teaching at college, I was a 
science major. He got me started in 
journal ism.
BRUNDLE
Did you manage to scrape him off 
your shoe?
VERONICA
We’re just platonic. We talk 
business.
40.
BRUNDLE
Is he still in love with you?
VERONICA
(LIGHTLY)
How could he not be?
(PAUSE)
What about our deal? You went 
through and I wasn’t there!
BRUNDLE
Don’t worry. I taped it for you.
VERONICA
You did?
Brundle nods.
VERONICA
But why? You were mad at me.
BRUNDLE
I wanted to hurt you. But I'm 
finding that if I don’t share 
everything with you, then it's... 
as if it hasn’t really happened.
VERONICA
That sounds like love.
BRUNDLE
It does?
VERONICA
Yeah, it does.
BRUNDLE
Well, you know about these things, 
right?
VERONICA
Yeah, I do.
She kisses him. They begin to make love.
The camera finds Veronica's hands as they clasp Brundle, then 
follows one of her hands as it moves down Brundle's s ide.
There, we see that the skin in the area of the three 
scratches has taken on a strange, rough texture. Even more 
startling, we see that HAIRS are growing out of the scratches 
- three from the top one, one from the middle scratch. And 
these hairs are decidedly NOT HUMAN: they are coarse, strong, 
and METALLIC-GREEN in color.
41.
Veronica’s fingers glide past the hairs without quite 
touching them.

CU BRUNDLE, asleep, lying on his back. We hear a faint 
buzzing. A FLY hovers near Brundle1s cheek, then lands.
He unconsciously brushes it away.
The FLY continues to buzz over Brundle1s head. Suddenly, 
Brundle makes an instinctive, eyes-closed grab for the 
insect.
With an amazing display of reflexes and speed, Brundle’s hand 
sweeps through the air and snatches the fly. We hear it 
BUZZING in Brundle’s hand.
The hand has not moved. Brundle’s arm remains in mid-air.
His fist clenches. He opens his eyes, now stone-cold awake, 
fully realizing what he’s done.
Brundle stares up at his hand. He slowly opens his fingers, 
releasing the fly. It buzzes off.
Brundle stares up at his hand, wondering about the feat he 
just performed. Blind luck? A fluke? Or something more? He 
flexes his fingers open and shut several times.
He smiles.
Brundle, totally nude, sits up on the edge of the bed, 
staring at his hands in curious pleasure. He turns, notices 
VERONICA in bed with him. He smiles at her sleeping form, 
turns, rubs his hands over his own chest.

Veronica peers tentatively around the corner of the half wall 
which separates the bedroom from the lab proper and finds 
herself looking at a strangely beautiful and unexpected 
sight.
Brundle, nude, bathed in shafts of soft morning light which 
highlight the rough textures of the warehouse walls and 
floors, is performing a series of slow, complex, highly 
controlled gymnastic maneuvers on the pipes and wooden studs 
which link the pillars of the lab.
Veronica is quietly astonished. She walks slowly into the 
lab, drawn and hypnotized by the beauty of the moment, not 
wanting to disturb it.
But soon she finds herself reaching out to touch Brundle as 
he twists and turns in slow motion. The spell doesn’t break; 
it’s as though he expected her. Brundle keeps performing, now 
with a sweet, shy smile.
VERONICA
I didn’t know you could do that 
stuff.
BRUNDLE
When I woke up, I felt like doing 
this. And I just started to do it.
(PAUSE)
I always... thought I could do 
something like this if I just... 
wanted to enough.
Brundle finally stops his exercises and stands squarely in 
front of Veronica. He is sweating, breathing hard.
He’s the same Brundle, and yet... he seems so much more 
physically self-aware, vibrant.
Veronica studies him carefully. She touches him again, traces 
the line of his collarbone with her finger. She takes his 
hand in hers and kisses it with great tenderness.

CAMERA.
VERONICA (OC)
43.
We've just seen the first 
teleportation of a human being. Dr. 
Seth Brundle, how did it feel going 
through? What did it feel like?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
It feels like a stutter.
VERONICA (OC)
A what?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
A stutter. A hiccup. A slight 
dislocation of my physical life. 
Not unpleasant. Just a title 
interruption of rhythm. For a 
second I thought it didn't work. I 
thought I was in the same telepod I 
started out in.
VERONICA (OC)
And did you feel at all different?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
A little... unbalanced. That's all.
VERONICA (OC)
And now?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
I should feel exactly the same as 
before, but I don’t. I’m not 
complaining. I feel very - 
coordinated. And very energized. I 
feel as though I work better, 
physically. Everything seems to 
just - work together better than it 
ever did before.
VERONICA (OC)
Why should that be?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
It’s possible that the teleporter 
has somehow... improved me.
VERONICA (OC)
But that's fantastic! How is it 
possible?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
44.
In reassembling me it might have - 
this is just a guess - but it might 
have just - seen where things could 
be improved - theoretically, and it 
did it. I told it to be creative, 
and I guess it has been.
VERONICA (OC)
Could this ever be dangerous?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
Well, it's certainly unexpected. 
The monkeys don't seem to exhibit 
any changes from their norm at all. 
We’ll see when they come back from 
testing.
VERONICA (OC)
But you haven’t really answered me. 
Could this be dangerous?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
It feels too perfect to be 
dangerous.
VERONICA (OS)
You like the way it feels?
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
Yes, I do.
(BIG SMILE)
Want to try it?
CUT TO:
CU VERONICA
live. She shakes her head "No."
EXT. KENSINGTON OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY
30
30
Lyrical montage as Brundle and Veronica walk the lively, 
bustling streets of Kensington Market hand in hand.
EXT. ITALIAN SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
31
31
We are CLOSE on a cup of cappuccino. Brundle’s hand comes 
into the shot and begins to dump spoonful after spoonful of 
sugar into the cup.
BRUNDLE (OC)
45.
... so I asked the computer if it 
had improved me and it said it 
didn’t know what I was talking 
about.
We pull back to see VERONICA sitting across from Brundle, 
watching him with some CONCERN. They sit at a table under an 
Alfa Romeo umbrella - a small Italian sidewalk café.
She bites a fingernail - Brundle’s habit - as the FIFTH 
TEASPOON OF SUGAR is dumped into the cup, but says nothing. 
Brundle, excited, wired-up, doesn’t seem to notice that he is 
doing anything odd. He speaks with a rapid fervour.
BRUNDLE
That made me think very carefully 
about what I’m feeling and why. I'm 
beginning to think that the sheer 
process of being taken apart, atom 
by atom, and then put back together 
again, why, it's like coffee being 
put through a filter. It's somehow 
a purifying process, it's purified 
me, it's cleansed me, it's allowed 
me to realize the personal 
potential I've been neglecting all 
these years that I've been 
obsessively pursuing goal after 
goal...
Brundle has been stirring the sugar into the cappuccino.
Now he pauses to drain the cup - without the slightest 
reaction to the incredible sweetness of the drink. He puts 
the cup down.
VERONICA
Do you normally take coffee with 
your sugar?
BRUNDLE
(DOESN'T GET IT)
What?
Veronica just shakes her head. Brundle reaches across the 
table and takes her hand. He continues to rattle on with 
incredible intensity.
BRUNDLE
I just don't think I've ever given 
me a chance to be me. And now that 
I’ve achieved what will probably 
prove to be my life’s work... I can 
be me, the real me, at last.
46.
For some reason, Veronica finds herself looking away.
INT. LAB. BEDROOM - LATE DAY
32
32
Veronica and Brundle are in bed making love - but something’s 
wrong. Veronica pushes Brundle away and rolls over in the 
bed, obviously exhausted.
VERONICA
I've got to stop. I have to sleep.
Brundle begins to caress her, kiss her.
BRUNDLE
Not yet.
Veronica sits up to get away from him.
VERONICA
I’ve got to. How can you keep 
going? You can't possibly have any 
fluid left in your body. We’ve been 
doing this for hours.
Brundle sits up behind her and begins to kiss her shoulder.
BRUNDLE
I’m not ready to stop.
Despite her fatigue, Veronica begins to respond. She holds 
Brundle, runs her hands down his back. Suddenly, she feels 
something that disturbs her. She stops, pulls away, searches 
Brundle’s body for whatever it was she felt.
VERONICA
Hey, what’s this?
BRUNDLE
It’s an attempt to distract me, 
that’s what it is.
VERONICA
No, I’m serious. Look at these.
Brundle lifts ,his arm and cranes his head around to get a 
look. What he sees are the STRANGE, METALLIC-GREEN HAIRS 
growing out of the scratches in his back - only now there are 
more of them, and they are longer, almost... bristly.
BRUNDLE
(NOT CONCERNED)
Happens when you get older. Weird 
hair configurations.
47.
VERONICA
They’re very coarse.
BRUNDLE
I’ve never really been hairy 
enough, you know what I mean? 
Always too boyish. I’m looking 
forward to a hairy body. One of the 
compensations of old age.
Veronica jumps up and grabs a pair of toenail scissors from 
the edge of the sink. She flops back down onto the bed and 
begins to attack the hairs with the scissors.
Brundle protests - but not seriously.
BRUNDLE
Hey - not my new hairs!
VERONICA
Relax, Brundle. I don’t think you 
really want a body covered with 
these. God, they’re really tough!
Veronica is having difficulty getting the scissors to cut 
through the hairs. Finally, she gets the first one trimmed 
off and starts on the next one* Brundle sits happily on the 
bed and begins to speed-rap again.
BRUNDLE
(SPEEDY BUT HAPPY)
Listen. I want you to go through. I 
want to teleport you. As soon as 
possible. Right now. You’ll feel 
incredible. Ronnie - I hardly need 
to sleep any more. And I feel 
wonderful. It’s like a drug, but a 
perfectly pure and benign drug. The 
power I feel surging inside me - 
you’ll feel fantastic. And I won’t 
be able to wear you out... We’ll be 
the perfect couple. The dynamic 
duo! C’mon. Right now!
He grabs her by the arm and begins to pull her off the bed. 
She pulls back, shrinking away from his craziness.
VERONICA
Hey, lay off, will you? Don’t give 
me that born-again teleportation 
rap. I told you I was scared to do 
it. What more do I need to say? I’m 
not going to do it!
48.
When he sees that she’s resisting, he lets go.
BRUNDLE
You're a fucking drag, you know 
that?
Veronica looks at Brundle, wide-eyed.
VERONICA
(VERY QUIETLY)
Something went wrong, Brundle. When 
you went through. Something went 
wrong.
Brundle completely ignores her words. He begins to throw on 
an outrageously wrong combination of clothes.
BRUNDLE
No? Not you? You’re too chicken-
shit to be a member of the dynamic 
duo club? OK, then, great, I’ll 
find somebody else. Somebody who 
can keep up with me!
VERONICA
Brundle, you’ve got to listen tome!
BRUNDLE
(ANGRY, SPEEDY)
You’re afraid to dive into the 
plasma pool, aren’t you? You’re 
afraid to be destroyed and 
reconsidered, aren’t you? You might 
think you were the one to teach me 
about the flesh, but you only know 
society’s straight line about the 
flesh, you can’t penetrate beyond 
society’s sick, gray fear of the 
flesh! Drink deep, or taste not the 
plasma spring, you see what I’m 
sayin’...? I’m not just talking 
about sex and penetration, I’m 
talking PENETRATION beyond the veil 
of the flesh, a deep, penetrating 
dive into the plasma pool...!
Brundle storms out the door, slamming it behind him.
VERONICA
No! Brundle, please, wait!
Veronica slides open the heavy door, thinking she might run 
after him - but the sound of his footsteps tells her she’ll 
never catch him: he’s fast, and he's gone.
49.
She comes back in, distraught but thinking. She goes back to 
the bed and looks for something in the twisted sheets.
She soon finds what she’s looking for - the FOUR OR FIVE 
STRANGE METALLIC-GREEN HAIRS she managed to trim from 
Brundle’s back.
Veronica lays the hairs out on the night table, then picks up 
the longest one and studies it in the light of the bed-lamp.
CU BRUNDLE’S WEIRD HAIR
It’s coarse and very animal-like, but also somehow beautiful 
in its iridescent greenness.
Veronica dumps an old telephone bill out of its envelope and 
drops all the hairs into the envelope for safe­ keeping.
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
33
33
Brundle stalks the neon-lit downtown streets, looking for a 
place to put his seething energy.
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
34
34
Brundle spots a bar that looks just about right - three or 
four shady women hanging around the entrance, along with an 
assortment of hungry men. Brundle pushes through the small 
group at the entrance and enters the bar.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
35
35
Brundle stands alone at the bar. In the garish neon of the 
place he no longer looks friendly and cuddly; he is angry, 
manic and, somehow... predatory.
Two large men with tattoos on their arms are arm-wrestling at 
a small table, egged on by a VOLUPTUOUSLY SLEAZY WOMAN. Beer 
is sloshing everywhere as the men struggle for an advantage.
The bartender puts a drink down - a double Scotch - in front 
of Brundle, who is in the process of unwrapping an O’Henry 
chocolate bar. The bartender winces as Brundle bites off a 
piece of chocolate then washes it down with some Scotch.
Brundle gets up and, still munching on his bar, begins to 
drift over to the table and the sleazy woman, whose name is 
TAWNY.
BRUNDLE
Who’s winning?
50.
TAWNY
Dunno. Hope it’s Marky.
BRUNDLE
How come?
TAWNY
’Cause the winner wins me, and I 
like Marky tonight.
BRUNDLE
Yeah? Well, I like you tonight. 
Maybe I’d better get involved in 
this, too.
The two men ease off their wrestling. The biggest one, MARKY, 
grabs Brundle by the lapels.
MARKY
You’re disturbing us.
BRUNDLE
I got a hundred bucks says I can 
beat either one of you.
The men laugh. Marky grabs Brundle’s arm and rips his jacket 
sleeve right off. He folds Brundle’s arm back and displays it 
to Tawny.
MARKY
Like those biceps, Tawny?
SECOND MAN
Hey, I know his secret.
(GRABS THE CHOCOLATE BAR 
AND SLURPS ALL OVER IT)
He eats chocolates and peanuts for 
energy!
They howl in laughter. Brundle pulls out a hundred-dollar 
bill which has been wadded up in his pocket. He slams the 
hundred on the table.
BRUNDLE
A hundred. And I get to take the 
lady home for the night if I win.
TAWNY
Says who?
MARKY
Hey - an easy hundred, Tawny.
TAWNY
51.
Yeah, but says who? It’s the idea 
of it. I ain’t no hooker.
Marky ignores her and sits down, ready to rumble.
MARKY
C’mon, let’s get it over with.
Having said her piece, Tawny sits down to enjoy the fun.
Brundle sits down opposite Marky. They spend a few minutes 
gripping and re-gripping each other’s hand under the scrutiny 
of the second man. A few spectators accumulate around the 
table.
Finally, they’re ready to wrestle.
ON BRUNDLE, as they start.
ON MARKY, confident.
ON BRUNDLE, having no trouble.
ON TAWNY, wondering what’s happening.
ON MARKY, his confidence turning to mush as he meets the 
steel in Brundle’s skinny forearm.
The tension is building between the two arms: they are 
shaking.
CU BRUNDLE - he’s doing well but it’s an effort.
CU BRUNDLE’S FINGERTIPS - the hand that’s wrestling.
Under the pressure of the fight, a STRANGE, PUS-LIKE 
SECRETION begins to ooze from under his fingernails and down 
the back of Marky’s hand. It goes unnoticed in the general 
sweat and beer.
The strain is enormous. Veins are bulging. Arms are 
quivering. Muscles are fibri1lating. Then SUDDENLY, all the 
pent-up energy is released with a sickening CRACK!
as MARKY’S FOREARM SHATTERS! Splintered bone slices out 
through the skin of Marky’s wristband glints in the icy light 
of the bar.
Marky shrieks in agony. Brundle lets go. Marky holds his arm 
and stares at it as though it belonged to someone else. His 
hand dangles at an impossible angle; the piece of cracked 
ulna looks white as a tooth. The second man and Tawny look on 
in disbelief.
52.
People begin to gather around. Marky starts to moan as blood 
begins to well up in a serious way and spill out of the wound 
onto the table top.
Brundle grabs his hundred dollars in one hand and takes Tawny 
by the wrist with the other. She's stunned and she lets 
herself be dragged out of the bar.
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
36
36
Once Brundle and Tawny are out on the street, Tawny recovers 
enough to talk.
TAWNY
( IN AMAZEMENT)
Jesus! Are you a body-builder or 
something?
BRUNDLE
Yeah, I build bodies. I take ’em 
apart and then I put ’em back 
together again.
TAWNY
(IN BREATHLESS 
ADMIRATION)
You sure took Marky apart.
BRUNDLE
Let’s go back to my place.
TAWNY
Your place?
(COY)
Yeah, well, OK. I live with my 
mother anyway. But could we go to a 
few more bars first? It’s too early 
to quit.
BRUNDLE
Sure. A few more bars.
EXT. LAB WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
37
37
A cab pulls up outside. Brundle and Tawny get out, blinking 
in the early morning light.
INT. LAB WAREHOUSE. STAIRWELL - EARLY MORNING
38
38
Confronted with the number of stairs, Tawny sits down heavily 
on the steps.
53.
TAWNY
Oh, no. No elevator. I’ll never 
make it.
BRUNDLE
There is an elevator.
Brundle picks her up effortlessly.
BRUNDLE
Don’t you feel elevated?
He sprints up the ten flights of stairs with Tawny in his 
arms.
TAWNY
You’re sure in good shape for 
somebody who only eats candy bars.
INT. LAB - MORNING
39
39
MONTAGE SEQUENCE
as Brundle, naked, teleports himself from one telepod to the 
other.
During this sequence, we watch Tawny’s amazed reactions as 
she sits on the mattress watching the process with a drink in 
her hand.
END MONTAGE SEQUENCE
Brundle steps from the receiving telepod. Tawny is impressed.
TAWNY
Wow! Are you a magician?
BRUNDLE
Yeah. Now it’s your turn.
TAWNY
I don’t think I want to try it.
BRUNDLE
Why not? It’ll make you feel sexy.
TAWNY
I already feel sexy. How about a 
nice alcohol rub?
54.
Tawny pushes Brundle down onto the mattress and starts to rub 
the booze over his skin. The instant the stuff hits his skin, 
he screams in pain, whipping around to slap the bottle out of 
her hand.
BRUNDLE
(SCREAMS)
Don’t do that! It hurts!
Tawny doesn’t seem to be the slightest bit intimidated by 
Brundle’s violence.
TAWNY
Sorry, Hun. I didn't realize you 
had the skin of a princess.
(SEXY VOICE)
Real sensitive, huh?
Brundle jumps up from the mattress and begins to pace back 
and forth like a maniac.
BRUNDLE
(PACING)
I want you to go through. I think 
you’ll like it.
TAWNY
But I don’t want to. I’m afraid.
BRUNDLE
Don’t be afraid.
A voice comes from out of the shadows by the door.
VERONICA
(TO TAWNY)
No - be afraid. Be very afraid.
Veronica steps into the light. Tawny is weirded out by 
Veronica’s dark tone of voice, by her gravity.
TAWNY
(WEIRDED OUT)
Who’s this?
BRUNDLE
I live with my mother, too. Mum, 
meet Tawny.
TAWNY
I think I’d better go. Thanks for 
the wonderful time.
55.
Tawny gets herself together in an amazingly short time - 
she's had practice - and is out the door in seconds. She 
doesn't look back.
Now Brundle comes out into the light and we take a close look 
at him - as does Veronica. We see that his skin seems very 
red and rough, his beard stubble thick, coarse, and flecked 
with the same metal 1ic green of the first few hairs that 
grew from his side . Hi s cheeks are gaunt, his eyes seem 
unnaturally wide-open.
BRUNDLE
Why did you scare her off? Jealous?
Brundle’s tone doesn’t bother Veronica. She’s functioning on 
a different level altogether.
VERONICA
You’re changing, Brundle. 
Everything about you is changing. 
You look bad. You smell bad.
BRUNDLE
I’ve never been much of a bather.
Veronica throws down the phone bill envelope with the 
metallic-green hairs in it. We can see the hairs through the 
plastic window in the envelope.
VERONICA
Those weird hairs that were growing 
out of your side - I took them to a 
lab, Brundle. Had them analyzed.
Brundle nervously picks up a candy bar and begins to eat it.
BRUNDLE
The hairs? Oh yeah.
(PAUSE)
That’s a strange thing to do.
VERONICA
Not as strange as the results. The 
guy at the lab had trouble 
identifying them. He finally came 
to the conclusion that they were 
definitely not human.
BRUNDLE
(LAUGHS)
Yeah?
VERONICA
(DEADLY SERIOUS)
56.
Not human, Brundle. In fact, very 
likely insect hairs.
BRUNDLE
That’s ridiculous. That’s silly.
She turns Brundle around. More hairs have already sprouted 
from the three scratches, thick, coarse, metal 1i c-green.
VERONICA
Look.
(BRUNDLE LOOKS)
Something happened when you went 
through, Brundle. You’ve got to get 
help! You’ve got to find out what 
went wrong!
Brundle freaks out.
BRUNDLE
(FREAKING)
Get out of here! You’re jealous, 
jealous! I’ve become free, I’ve 
been released and you can’t stand 
it! You’ll do anything to bring me 
down. Look at me! Does this look 
like a sick man? Does this look 
sick?
He begins to PUNCH AWAY chunks of an immense wooden support 
beam with his right fist! Shards of wood fly everywhere. He 
smashes it and smashes it until Veronica puts her hands over 
her ears and screams at him.
VERONICA
(SCREAMS)
Stop! Stop it!
BRUNDLE
Do you know any sick old men who 
can do that? GET OUT! Get out!
Brundle actually pushes and shoves her out the door, then 
slides it closed behind her. He makes a lot of noise locking 
it up, so that she knows he’s serious.
EXT. LAB WAREHOUSE. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE THE DOOR - DAY
40
40
Veronica bursts into tears. Brundle yells at her through the 
door.
VERONICA
(SOBBING)
57.
Brundle! You’re comnitting suicide! 
Please don’t do it! Please don’t!
BRUNDLE (OC)
Don’t come back. The deal’s off. I 
don’t need you any more!
She runs off down the stairs, crying as she goes.
INT. LAB - DAY
41
41
Brundle, now very alone, feels his beard, then feels the 
hairs on his side.
INT. LAB. BATHROOM - DAY
42
42
Brundle is in the bathroom, studying himself in the mirror. 
He does not look well. He looks cancerously gaunt. He picks 
up his electric razor and begins to shave the strange hairs 
off his face. The razor snags painfully in the hairs and 
keeps jamming. Finally it stops working.
Brundle throws the razor down in anger, then begins to bite 
nervously at his fingernail.
To his (and our) horror, THE NAIL COMES OFF IN HIS MOUTH!
THE ENTIRE NAIL. Brundle spits it out in disgust. He examines 
the tip of his now nail-less finger. It is swollen and sore-
looking, and there is a series of small holes where there 
used to be a nail.
Brundle squeezes his fingertip. A STICKY PUS-LIKE FLUID 
SPURTS from the nail onto the mirror, then continues to ooze 
for seconds after Brundle has stopped squeezing.
Brundle takes toilet paper and tries to clean off his finger, 
but the paper sticks to the fluid and makes a complete, gooey 
mess.
Brundle now gingerly tests another fingernail. It seems 
loose. He squeezes that fingertip and the nail pops off, goo 
oozing out from underneath it. The nail next to it splits 
open of its own accord, ready to fall off at any instant.
Brundle is weak in the knees. He clutches the towel rack for 
support and sits on the edge of the tub.
BRUNDLE
(SUDDENLY VERY AFRAID)
Oh, no. What’s happening? Am I 
dying? Is that it?
58.
(YELLS)
Is this how it starts? Am I dying?
INT. LAB - LATE DAY
43
43
We are tight on the keyboard of the computer. Brundle's hands 
- clothed in a mismatched pair of old cloth gardening gloves 
- come into the shot and take a disc out of the disc-holder. 
The title of the disc is "FIRST TRANSMISSION - S. BRUNDLE."
The disc goes into the slot.
The machine is turned on.
Brundle’s face is sweaty and intense.
Brundle's gloved fingers dance over the keys.
MONITOR - we see a flood of figures and tables as the machine 
retraces the steps recorded during Brundle's first tipsy 
teleportation of himself.
On the monitor Brundle sees himself outlined and analyzed and 
diagrammed. AND THEN he sees something strange: ANOTHER 
OUTLINE - THE OUTLINE OF A FLY! It's in CU, complete with 
tables, etc.
Now the screen splits into two and the outlines disintegrate. 
A few beats later, the reintegration is charted, BUT THERE IS 
ONLY AN OUTLINE OF BRUNDLE!
Brundle now types into the machine: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FLY? 
by using the code number attached to the outline of the fly.
The machine answers: FUSION.
Brundle asks for clarification. DO YOU MEAN ASSIMILATION?
DID BRUNDLE ABSORB THE FLY?
The answer is NO: FUSION OF FLY AND BRUNDLE AT THE MOLECULAR-
GENETIC LEVEL.
CU BRUNDLE
He is now very afraid.
INT. VERONICA’S APT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
44
44
59.
Veronica is working late on her mini-word processor. The 
small, cheap printer is printing. She’s drinking coffee, 
smoking too many cigarettes. There are scientific journals 
and reference books spread open everywhere. The phone rings.
VERONICA
(ANSWERING PHONE, 
DISTRACTED)
Yeah?
There is a long pause before anyone speaks. Veronica 
immediately knows it’s Brundle.
VERONICA
Brundle?
(NO ANSWER)
Brundle, I’ve been trying to reach 
you for five days. Where are you?
BRUNDLE (PHONE)
(SO DOWN HE’S ALMOST 
INAUDIBLE)
I’ve been afraid to see you. Now, 
I’m afraid not to.
VERONICA
Where are you? Are you at home?
BRUNDLE
Veronica... you... you don’t know 
how right you were... Please come 
to see me. Please come now.
INT. LAB - NIGHT
45
45
Veronica slides open the door, which is unlocked. She comes 
inside, sliding the door closed behind her.
She begins to walk from the darkness into the light. As she 
walks towards the bedroom, she sees that the place is 
littered with candy wrappers, donut boxes, empty soda cans, 
half-eaten pastries, chocolate boxes... you name it.
Brundle is lying slumped on an old sofa. He wears socks on 
his feet and gloves on his hands. The gloves and socks are 
wet and sticky.
She approaches him, fearful. He doesn’t seem to know she’s in 
the room.
VERONICA
I’m here, Brundle.
60.
Brundle looks up, dazed. He’s gotten worse fast. His cheeks 
have sunk more, but now his temples have swollen grotesquely 
and there are two separate lumps high on his forehead. The 
metal 1ic-green hair seems to have grown all over his face - 
it’s patchy in spots, but is growing where hair shouldn't 
grow - right up to the rims of his eyes and over his 
forehead.
Brundle looks up at Veronica. His eyes finally manage to 
focus on her, then well up with tears which stream down his 
face and get tangled in his beard. When he speaks, his voice 
is scratchy, raspy.
BRUNDLE
Don't come too close to me.
VERONICA
Why not?
BRUNDLE
I’m diseased. You were right. It 
could be contagious somehow. I 
wouldn’t want to infect you.
Veronica sits down on the sofa amid all the junk-food 
remains.
VERONICA
What happened?
BRUNDLE
(IRONIC, TEARFUL LAUGH)
I know an old lady who swallowed a 
fly. Perhaps she’ll die.
VERONICA
(VERY DISTURBED)
Brundle, please...
BRUNDLE
(HE.CAN’T STOP THE 
METAPHYSICAL SPEED-RAP)
Impurity. Lack of integrity. Where 
does the body stop and the outside 
world begin?
(SUDDENLY INTENSE)
I was not pure. The teleporter 
insists on inner purity, and I was 
not pure.
VERONICA
(VERY QUIETLY)
I don’t know what you mean.
61.
BRUNDLE
A fly got into the transmitter pod 
with me. That first time. When I 
was alone. The computer got 
confused - there weren’t supposed 
to be two separate genetic patterns 
- and it decided to splice.us 
together.
(LAUGHS)
It mated us, me and the fly. We 
hadn’t even been properly 
introduced. My teleporter turned 
into a gene-splicer, and a very 
good one. And now I’m not Seth 
Brundle any more - I’m the 
offspring of Brundle and housefly.
VERONICA
(HORRIFIED)
Oh, my God.
(PAUSE)
What... what will happen?
BRUNDLE
I think it’s showing itself as a 
bizarre form of cancer. General 
cellular chaos and revolution. I’m 
just going to disintegrate - in a 
novel way, no doubt. And then I’ll 
die, and then it’ll be over.
VERONICA
No! I don’t accept that. There must 
be something we can do. There must 
be somebody we can go to, tests 
that can be done...
BRUNDLE
(sardonically scratching 
at his ear in IRRITATION)
No. I won’t be just another 
tumorous bore, talking endlessly 
about his hair falling out and his 
lost lymph nodes. I know what 
that's all about and I won’t go 
through it!
VERONICA
(ANGRY FOR BEING 
CHASTISED)
Then what do you want me to do? Why 
did you call me?
BRUNDLE
62.
Keep to your part of the deal. Tape 
me, record me. This is, after all, 
the continuation of the Pulitzer 
prize-winning epic, isn’t it? And 
everyone is just as interested to 
know what went wrong, as what went 
right - maybe more interested.
He leans forward and spills out the contents of a plastic bag 
at the foot of the sofa - junk food, all of it sweet.
He grabs a donut and jams it into his mouth. White goop 
instead of saliva drips from his chin. Thicker, more viscous. 
He talks while he chews.
BRUNDLE
It’s disgusting, isn’t it? You’ve 
got to get back behind the video 
camera. People will want to know... 
they’ll want to see with their own 
eyes...
Brundle suddenly begins to scratch and tug again at one of 
his ears. IT COMES OFF and drops onto the sofa, looking like 
a black, shriveled-up potato chip amongst the junk food.
Brundle stops in his tracks and stares at the ear.
Despite his foray into angry wit, Brundle is now stunned, 
broken. He picks the ear up and cradles it in his hand.
BRUNDLE
(STUNNED, SHOCKED)
My... my ear...!
Veronica stares on, horrified, paralyzed. Brundle begins to 
cry, to wail hopelessly, and Veronica has to go to him, to 
hold him, to rock him in her arms. But even as she does so, 
she sees that Brundle’s other ear is also turning black 
around the edges, shrivel1ing...
Brundle keeps sobbing.
BRUNDLE
(SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY)
Help me, help me. Please... please 
help me!
INT. STATHIS’S OFFICE - DAY
46

Veronica and Stathis are talking about Brundle.
STATHIS
63.
Don’t go back to him. Call the 
police, the Public Health 
Department.
VERONICA
That’s your advice? That's it?
STATHIS
But he’s right, don’t you see? It 
could be contagious. It could turn 
into an epidemic.
VERONICA
I’ve got to go back to him. He’s 
got no one else. If you saw him 
Stath... if you saw how scared and 
angry and pitiful he is...
STATHIS
I’m sure Typhoid Mary was a very 
nice lady, too. When you met her 
socially.
(GRABS HER ARM)
Listen, I don’t want you to...
VERONICA
(SHAKES HIM OFF)
I don't care what you want!
STATHIS
(HANDS-OFF GESTURE)
Sure, OK. Just tell me... do I have 
your permission to claim your body 
after it's all over ?
Veronica can’t stop a bit of a smile from showing.
Stathis takes the opportunity to make peace.
STATHIS
Look... how about this? You say if 
I only saw him. OK - show me. Tape 
him. He wants you to anyway, right? 
Show me, and let me think about 
what we might be able to do. But 
don’t get close. Please.
EXT. LAB WAREHOUSE - DAY
47
47
Veronica gets out of her car in front of the lab. She 
hesitates just that telltale beat before she slams the car 
door and begins to walk towards the front door.
64.
INT. LAB - DAY
48
48
Veronica enters the lab and immediately puts her hand to her 
face - the stench is very, very strong, and the litter on the 
floor and everywhere else has accumulated at an alarming 
rate.
ANGLE FROM CEILING LOOKING DOWN ON VERONICA
as she makes her way through the litter, looking for Brundle.
VERONICA
Brundle?
BRUNDLE (OS)
I'm here.
Veronica’s gaze follows the voice - up to the ceiling.
VERONICA’S POV
We realize that a moment ago we were looking at Veronica from 
Brundle’s POV FOR HE HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE CEILING BY 
ALL FOURS!
If this weren’t startling enough, the changes in his 
appearance most certainly are. He’s completely naked, and his 
torso is beginning to be covered all over with metallic-green 
hair.
And his musculature has changed again - stringy and powerful, 
not like a gymnast. Not human. A hernia-like bulge protruding 
from his left side is the only suggestion of weakness in his 
grotesquely sleek shape.
Brundle scrambles adroitly across the ceiling, then down the 
wall. Veronica watches with her eyes huge.
VERONICA
Brundle... I...
BRUNDLE
Gotten pretty good at it, haven’t 
I? It’s almost second nature.
(HOLDS UP HIS HANDS)
Stopped biting my nails, too.
Veronica can only stare at him. He approaches her, still in 
shadow.
BRUNDLE
65.
I seem to be stricken by a disease 
with a purpose, wouldn’t you say? 
Maybe not such a bad disease after 
all.
She shakes her head in disbelief, then turns to leave.
VERONICA
(OVERWHELMED)
I can’t stay here.
Brundle grabs her. His fingers are longer, thinner. They have 
no more nails on them, they glisten with the oily secretion. 
His palms are forming small, cushion-like pads. His feet - 
the same, the toes long and oily.
BRUNDLE
Why not? Why can’t you?
Veronica can not bear to look at him.
VERONICA
(WITH DIFFICULTY)
Can’t take it... Too much.
Brundle moves out into the light and we can now see how much 
more his face has changed. His skull has swollen even more at 
the temples and his forehead as well, so that the entire 
shape of his skull has altered. And his face is now covered 
with the metallic-green hair, so that there is not a square 
centimeter of normal flesh showing.
Brundle’s eyes are almost lost in this new face, but they are 
now very bright and piercing.
BRUNDLE
What's there to take? The disease 
has just revealed its purpose. We 
don't have to worry about contagion 
any more. I know what the disease 
wants.
Veronica looks down at the hand holding her arm, then forces 
herself to look Brundle in the face.
VERONICA
What...what does the disease want?
BRUNDLE
It wants to turn me into something 
else. That's not too terrible, is 
it? Most people would give anything 
to be turned into something else.
66.
VERONICA
Turned into what? An insect?
Brundle lets her go - his fingers stick momentarily to the 
arm of her blouse - and laughs, a harsh, grating little 
laugh.
BRUNDLE
You mean a fly? Am I turning into a 
hundred-and-eighty-pound fly?
He laughs again.
BRUNDLE
No, I’m becoming something that 
never existed before. I’m 
becoming... Brundlefly.
(SLOWLY, STRETCHING IT 
OUT)
B-R-U-N-D-L-E-F-L-Y.
(PAUSE)
Don’t you think that’s worth a 
Nobel Prize or two?
Veronica just stands there, defeated by his sarcasm and 
defeated by the rapidly accelerating bizarreness of his 
condition.
BRUNDLE
(SUDDEN ENTHUSIASM)
C’MON, NOW. LET’S GO.
Brundle begins to take charge, full of enthusiasm. He gently 
but firmly places Veronica behind the ever-present video 
camera, and then bustles around, his movements awkward and 
strange, setting up a chair and table in front of the camera.
BRUNDLE
I want to give a demonstration that 
I think you’ll want to record for 
posterity. Yes, yes. I think you 
must chronicle the rise and fall of 
Brundlefly, don't you? At the very 
least, it should make a fabulous 
children’s book. Do they give 
Pulitzer Prizes for kiddies' books?
INT. VERONICA'S APT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
49
49
We are tight on the screen of Veronica's TV set, watching the 
demonstration that Brundle was just talking about.
67.
On the tape, Brundle is sitting at a table in his lab with a 
pile of his usual junk food in front of him. He is smiling - 
a still-recognizable smile, since his jaw and mouth have not 
undergone any change in shape, though his jaw is covered with 
metallic-green beard.
BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
How does Brundlefly eat? Well, he 
found out the hard and painful way 
that he eats very much the way a 
fly eats. His teeth are now 
useless, because although he can 
chew up solid food, he can’t digest 
it. Solid food hurts. So, like a 
fly, Brundlefly breaks down solids 
with a corrosive enzyme playfully 
called "vomit drop.” He 
regurgitates on his food, liquefies 
it, then sucks it back up. Ready 
for a demonstration, kids? Here 
goes.
Brundle now bends close to the food until his face is almost 
touching it.
We pop back to AN ANGLE WHICH EXCLUDES THE TV SCREEN and see 
that Stathis is watching alone in the living room. He is 
shaken by what he is watching.
STATHIS
(SHAKEN)
Oh my God, my God.
From the TV’s speaker we hear hideous, enthusiastic slurping 
and sucking sounds, BUT WE DO NOT SEE WHAT STATHIS SEES.
Stathis runs his hands through his hair. He leans forward and 
switches off the tape machine. His upper lip is beaded with 
sweat. He wipes it off with his sleeve.
Veronica comes in the front door and, without a word, sweeps 
past Stathis and down the hall.
STATHIS
(CALLING OUT TO HER)
Hey, Ronnie? I don’t blame you for 
not wanting to watch it. Ronnie?
No response.
He gets up and leaves the living room, looking for Veronica.
INT. VERONICA’S APT. HALLWAY - DAY

68.
Stathis walks down the hallway, worried.
STATHIS
Ronnie? Where are you?
Stathis hears sobbing coming from the direction of the 
bathroom. He turns and sprints down the hallway.
INT. VERONICA’S APT. BATHROOM - DAY
51
51
Stathis appears in the doorway of the bathroom. Veronica is 
sobbing her heart out, slumped against the bathroom counter. 
She’s still wearing her coat. Stathis steps inside the 
bathroom and puts his arm around her.
STATHIS
(VERY GENTLY)
What is it?
Veronica tries to answer but can’t, she’s sobbing so 
profoundly. She turns to him, barely able to get it out.
VERONICA
(WITH DIFFICULTY)
I saw a doctor. I’m... I’m 
pregnant, Stath.
STATHIS
Oh, no. Oh, no.
He holds her tight.
VERONICA
(RENEWED SOBBING)
I'm pregnant with Brundle’s baby!
Stathis hugs her again, then holds her at arms length so that 
he can look her in the eye.
STATHIS
What do you want to do?
Veronica, still racked by sobs, tries to wipe her eyes.
VERONICA
(TEARFULLY)
I don’t know. I just don’t know.
INT. LAB - NIGHT
52
52
69.
We are close on Brundle’s fingers as they dance over the keys 
of the computer keyboard. Brundle has cut the fingers off a 
pair of yellow rubber kitchen gloves and jammed them down 
over his fingertips, so that his fingers won’t stick to the 
keyboard.
CU MONITOR
which reads :
GENE-SPLICING PROGRAM NOW IN PLACE
TELEPOD 1: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT A
TELEPOD 2: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT B
TELEPOD 3: RECEIVER POD FOR GENETICALLY FUSED A-B COMBINATION 
SUBJECT
We pull back to see that in front of Brundle and his keyboard 
stand not two, but THREE telepods, the third one of a 
somewhat older and more handbuilt vintage than the other two 
- the original PROTOTYPE TELEPOD which has been sitting in 
corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and was noticed by 
Veronica on her first visit to the lab.
In TELEPOD A sits a monkey, in TELEPOD B an alley cat. 
TELEPOD C, the old prototype receiver, is empty.
Brundle operates the machine. The monitor says,
READY FOR FUSION
Brundle presses the ACCEPT button.
The telepods go through their normal disintegration routine 
as the animals’ outlines appear on the monitor in split 
screen fashion.
But now, as the reintegration process begins, a stream of 
data concerning this new experiment, the fusion of monkey and 
cat, floods the screen. The basic message that gets across to 
us through all the hi-tech compu-talk is:
PERENTAGE OF MONKEY - 63
PERCENTAGE OF CAT - 37
These numbers fluctuate as the machine tries to strike a 
molecular balance between the two creatures.
70.
Finally, an outline of the fused creature begins to form on 
the screen. Brundle looks up at the old third telepod to see 
the actual creature forming, and it is indeed grotesque: two 
heads - one monkey, one eat - at odd angles to each other, 
six legs which are not quite symmetrically placed on the 
monkey torso, cat tail.
As the creature solidifies and the light goes off, it sits 
there in the telepod for a moment, stunned, half­ reclining as 
though crippled.
Brundle gets up, goes to the third telepod, and with great 
apprehension, opens the door.
The thing just sits there, slumped for a beat, then SUDDENLY 
LEAPS UP AT HIM, its two heads SHRIEKING! It jumps on his 
arm, clinging, snarling, then drops to the floor. The two 
heads begin to bite each other, blood begins to flow - the 
thing now running around in mad floppy circles, smearing 
blood everywhere.
Brundle is horrified. He grabs a metal rod leaning in a 
corner and begins to smash at the deformed thing. He keeps 
smashing at it until it stops its hideous screeching and lies 
dead, mangled on the floor.
Brundle wraps it up in a towel and throws it into the 
refrigerator. He draws the old torn sheet back down over the 
third telepod so that he doesn't have to look at it again.
Back at the monitor, the screen is flashing the words:
FUSION SUCCESSFUL
RECEIVER TELEPOD 3
Brundle puts his face in his hands for a few moments, then 
pulls himself together. He pulls the rubber fingertips off 
his fingers and throws them to the ground.
Brundle has now developed some insect-like tics and 
mannerisms, his head twitching with nervous little jerks and 
his long fingers in constant motion. We now see clearly that 
all of Brundle’s fly characteristics have been accentuated 
even further. The metal 1ic-green hair which completely 
covers his face is much thicker than before, and the hernia-
like bulge in his side is more protuberant now, stretched to 
the bursting point and obviously causing Brundle some pain.
Brundle looks up at the skylight. The sky is clear, the moon 
is a scimitar. On an impulse, he jumps up on the wall, 
sticking there for a beat. Then, with incredible agility, he 
ascends the wall, crosses the ceiling towards the skylight.
71.
ON THE CEILING
Brundle glides on all fours, upside down, towards the 
skylight. Once there, he crawls into it and opens it up.
EXT. LAB ROOFTOP - NIGHT
53
53
Brundle clambers out of the skylight onto the roof. The night 
is gorgeous, clean and bright, the sky pocked with stars. 
Brundle breathes deeply. He is still alive, isn’t he? He can 
still respond to the beauty of the night, can’t he?
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. MONTAGE - BRUNDLE’S TRAVELS - NIGHT
54
54
We follow Brundle on his solitary sojourn in a MONTAGE 
SEQUENCE. He climbs walls with amazing ability, leaps from 
rooftop to rooftop, hangs upside down from ledges and 
lampposts, eavesdropping on the city life around and below 
him, the inhabitants unaware of the unusual and shadowy 
observer in their midst.
He scurries along the girder of a bridge, gazing down on the 
traffic and the river below him.
These moments should be poetic, even beautiful, joyous.
The moon is luminous, the dark night exquisite. Resigned to 
his fate and momentarily forgetful of his future, Brundle 
seems to be revealing in his unique powers.
A brief euphoric fling.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
55
55
Brundle leaps across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the 
building opposite him. He smiles with smug satisfaction at 
his feat, then suddenly winces, grabbing his side with one of 
his hands.
WE HEAR A CRACKING, SPLITTING SOUND. Brundle muffles a 
startled cry and, losing his balance, slides several feet 
down the wall before regaining hold.
He looks down at the huge bulge in his side... IT IS STARTING 
TO SPLIT OPEN! Brundle is horrified and in pain.
72.
He starts to quickly move down the side of the building, but 
the pain impedes his progress.
He manages to get down at least another floor before he’s hit 
with another sharp pain. He doubles up and his tenuous grip 
on the wall causes him to slide another several feet downward 
before he regains his grip.
The side is gaping wide open now and SOMETHING is starting to 
protrude. Brundle is in shock. Another ripple of pain causes 
him to release his grasp entirely and he falls to the ground 
in a dirty narrow alley, where he writhes on his back in 
pain, as a STRANGE, HAIRY STICKLIKE APPENDAGE — ACTUALLY THE 
BEGINNINGS OF A FLYLIKE LEG -- begins to unfold awkwardly out 
of his side. Despite his excruciating pain, Brundle watches 
with fixated, wide-eyed terror at his latest transformation!
The insect leg now begins to probe around, function like a 
real leg, almost with a mind of its own. Grotesque as Brundle 
himself has become, he can’t accept the next step towards 
real insectness which this new leg represents. He screams at 
the leg.
BRUNDLE
(SCREAMING AT THE LEG)
No I No, I won’t! I won’t, I won’t, 
I won’t...!
Brundle grabs at the leg, holds it, subdues it, and then 
begins to gnaw with his teeth at its base, twisting himself 
into a agonized ball in order to do it.
The leg begins to lever at his back, small hooklike 
protrusions all along its underside catching in the flesh of 
Brundle’s back, tearing it in protest against Brundle’s 
attempt at amputation.
Finally, Brundle has severed the leg with his teeth. The leg 
drops off leaving a strand or two of stringy gristle hanging 
from the knobby stump in Brundle’s side. The leg twitches on 
the ground, tries to extend itself.
Brundle looks at the leg in shock, his eyes crazed, like an 
animal who has been caught in a leg-trap and has had to gnaw 
the leg off to be free. Brundle tries to steady himself, then 
staggers away down the alley. As he goes, he wipes the insect 
blood from his lips with his two forearms - IN EXACTLY THE 
SAME WAY THAT FLIES CLEAN THEIR FACES!

Stathis holds Veronica’s hand as she is wheeled down the

VERONICA
Stath...I’m scared!
STATHIS
It’s going to be all right, Ronnie. 
It’s going to be fine.
VERONICA
(TEARFUL)
I don’t think I want to lose it. Is 
there something wrong with me? Why 
am I losing it?
STATHIS
It’s better this way, Ronnie. 
You’ll see. It’s the best thing 
that could happen.
INT. HOSPITAL WARD - CLOSE-UP - OPERATING LIGHT

The dehumanizing blue-white light of an OVERHEAD OPERATING-
ROOM LAMP. WE HEAR VERONICA'S MOANS... AND VOICES.
VOICE #1 (OS)
She's expelling it. We won’t even 
have to go in.
(TO VERONICA)
It’s going to be easy. Don’t worry, 
honey.
VERONICA (OS)
Please, Brundle, please don’t...
THE CAMERA PANS FROM THE LAMP TO AN OPERATING TABLE BELOW. 
Veronica is miscarrying right there on the table.
A TEAM OF DOCTORS AND NURSES work over her.
STATHIS stands at the head of the table, still holding 
Veronica’s hand. Veronica grimaces and groans. A NURSE mops 
her sweaty brow.
NURSE
OK, that’s it. We’ve got it.
74.
DOCTOR
No, no. There’s more in there. A 
lot more.
NURSE
(SURPRISED)
There’s more?
DOCTOR
C’mon, girl. You can help us out. 
Give us a push. Push!
(VERONICA DOES)
Thatta girl. We’re getting it.
VERONICA
(INCOHERENT, IN PAIN)
No, no...wait! Brundle, please, 
no...!
DOCTOR
That’s it. That’s it. It’s coming. 
It’s...
(SUDDEN HORROR)
...Ohh, my God!
VERONICA'S POV - ON EXPELLED FOETUS
...as the doctor lifts it out of the womb. Perhaps there are 
some human features about the face, if indeed there is a face 
at all on THE HIDEOUS, SQUIRMING GIANT FLY­ MAGGOT!
Stathis registers unutterable HORROR. Veronica SCREAMS.
QUICK CUT TO:
INT. VERONICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
59
59
Veronica wakes up screaming. She’s alone in bed. She’s been 
dreaming. Once she realizes she has not given birth to a fly-
maggot baby, she starts to laugh at herself - then, 
remembering that she is pregnant by Brundle, she begins to 
weep again.
INT. LAB - NIGHT
60
60
Brundle is working away at the computer keyboard - only now 
he has to use pencils, one in each hand, to push the keys: 
his fingers are losing their human flexibility.
The words on the monitor read:
THE BRUNDLEFLY PROJECT
75.
PROBLEM: TO REFINE GENETIC FUSION PROGRAM
GOAL: TO DECREASE TO A MINIMUM THE PERCENTAGE
OF ”FLY” IN BRUNDLEFLY
SOLUTION: THE FUSION BY GENE-SPLICING OF BRUNDLEFLY
WITH ONE OR MORE "PURE” HUMAN BEINGS
As Brundle thinks about his next step, he begins to chew on 
one of the pencils. He is soon distracted by the sound of 
several small, hard things dropping onto the keyboard. 
Brundle looks down. Five small, white chunks of something lie 
partially hidden in the crevices between the plastic keys, 
Brundle digs one out with the pencil. It is a tooth, its 
jagged root smeared with blood, and it has just fallen out of 
Brundle’s mouth.
Brundle begins to roar with laughter. He clumsily digs the 
rest of the teeth out of the keys, then carries them over to 
the refrigerator. As he walks, he delivers a little speech to 
the teeth which sit attentively in the palm of what used to 
be his hand.
BRUNDLE
(LAUGHING, TALKING TO HIS 
TEETH)
You’re relics. Yes, you are. You 
can’t deny it. Vestigial, 
archaeological, redundant. 
Artifacts of a bygone era. Of 
historical interest only. How long 
will it take for you and all the 
other manifestations of the Brundle 
Age, the Stone Age, to fall away, 
to reveal the Future...?
He opens the fridge and carefully places the teeth in an ice 
cube tray. The fridge is empty except for a few other barely 
recognizable lost appendages - Brundle’s shriveled ears, his 
fingernails.
Suddenly, Brundle hears the door to the lab slide noisily 
open. He turns, startled.
Veronica steps warily into the lab - she has kept her keys to 
the building. Brundle looks wildly around the room - in 
guilt? in shame? - closes the fridge door and walks quickly 
over to the computer keyboard. He picks up a pencil with 
desperate awkwardness and uses it to press the keyboard's 
STORE button. It is obvious that he does not want Veronica to 
see what he’s been working on.
76.
Veronica approaches him but stops some distance away. She is 
stunned by the changes in his appearance, struggling for some 
kind of emotional equilibrium. They stand frozen for a beat, 
then Brundle begins to speak. But even Brundle’s voice has 
become a horror: it is scratchy and metallic, and full of 
guttural, insect twitters.
BRUNDLE
(INSECT VOICE)
You’ve missed some good moments. Is 
that why you’re here? To catch up?
VERONICA
(SHAKEN, HESITANT)
I... wanted... What were you 
putting in the fridge?
BRUNDLE
(MATTER-OF FACT)
My teeth. They’ve started to fall 
out. The fridge is now the Brundle 
Museum of Natural History. Want to 
see what else is in it?
VERONICA
No.
BRUNDLE
(MERCILESS)
Then what do you want?
VERONICA
(FALTERING)
I came to tell you that... I came 
to tell you... I... I just had to 
see you... before...
Tears begin to well up in Veronica’s eyes.
BRUNDLE
You’ve got to go, now, and never 
come back here.
(PAUSE)
Have you ever heard of insect 
politics?
Veronica shakes her head, completely baffled.
BRUNDLE
77.
Well, neither have I. Insects don’t 
have politics. They’re very brutal. 
No compassion. No compromise. We 
can’t trust the insect. But I'd 
like to become the first. .. first 
insect politician. I’d like to, but 
I’m afraid...
VERONICA
I don’t... know... what you’re 
trying to say...
BRUNDLE
I’m saying... that I don't... feel 
very human any more. I'm saying I'm 
an insect who dreamt he was a man, 
and loved it, but now the dream is 
over, and the insect is awake.
Veronica bursts out crying.
VERONICA
(MOVED TO TEARS)
Brundle, please... no...
BRUNDLE
(SLOW, CAREFUL, 
DELIBERATE)
I’m saying, I’ll hurt you if you 
stay.
Veronica bursts out crying. Brundle doesn’t move.
Veronica turns and runs out of the lab.
Brundle remains motionless, and from a distance seems 
completely dispassionate. But when we move close to his face, 
we see that he too is crying.
EXT. LAB - NIGHT

Veronica bursts out of the lab door and runs across the 
street to where Stathis is leaning against her car, waiting.

Veronica tries to pull open the door of the car but Stathis 
grabs her, puts his arms around her.
Veronica pulls free, her eyes streaming tears. But despite 
the tears, her face is set hard now, determined.
78.
VERONICA
Let’s go. Let’s do it now.
STATHIS
Now? Wait a minute. What did he say 
when you told him?
VERONICA
I couldn’t tell him. I couldn’t...
(SHOUTS)
Let's go, dammit!
STATHIS
I think we should wait a few days. 
I don't think you’re in the right 
state of mind...
VERONICA
No! Now! I want it out of my body 
now! You should have seen him. 
There could be anything in there, 
in me, in my body!
STATHIS
But I don’t know if I can arrange 
it now, right now, tonight. Why do 
we have to run around in the dark 
like ...?
VERONICA
(FREAKING)
Because I don’t want it in my body! 
Do you understand? I don’t want it 
in my body!
Veronica gets into the car. She hugs herself tightly and 
turns her face away from Stathis. Stathis stares at her for a 
beat, then gets into the car himself.

STATHIS
Hi, Brent. Thanks.
(INTRODUCES VERONICA)
Veronica Quaife.
CHEEVERS
(TO VERONICA)
Hi.
(VERONICA JUST NODS)
Well, OK. What’s the story?
Although Cheevers has directed this question to Veronica, it 
is Stathis who answers.
STATHIS
She's pregnant and she wants an 
abortion.
CHEEVERS
In the middle of the night?
STATHIS
We have good reason to think that 
this child will be deformed.
CHEEVERS
Yeah, but... in the middle of the 
night?
STATHIS
Look, Brent... please.
CHEEVERS
Is it your child?
STATHIS
No. It 's the child of a man who is 
deformed.
CHEEVERS
80.
Listen, I don't mean to interfere, 
but... I detect a certain... 
uncertainty here. You know, there 
are tests that can be done to 
determine whether or not...
VERONICA
(BARELY CONTROLLED)
I don' t want tests! Tests can't 
guarantee anything. The baby could 
start off normal and then become a 
monster. I want an abortion! I'll 
do it myself if I have to!
Although Veronica speaks quietly, Cheevers can easily see how 
disturbed she is, how close to the edge. He seems to be 
picturing Veronica trying to abort her own baby.
CHEEVERS
(PAUSE)
No, I don’t think you should do 
that.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
66
66
The clinic operating room is surprisingly simple, spartan - 
really not much more than a standard examination room except 
for two unusual features.
The first unusual feature is the immense floor-to-ceiling 
window which composes one wall of the room - a legacy from 
the building’s history as a small office complex.
The window has been frosted to provide privacy.
The second unusual feature is a TV set above the small 
operating table.
Cheevers adjusts the TV set on its swivel so that Veronica 
wi11 be able to see it when she lies down on the table. She 
is, at the moment, sitting quietly in a chair in the corner 
of the room.
CHEEVERS
I've found TV to be the best 
anesthetic.
He turns it on. &• commercial, for Pampers is on. Adorable 
kids toddling everywhere.
CHEEVERS
81.
(EMBARRASSED)
Oh, shit.
STATHIS
Uh... maybe no TV...
To the men's surprise, Veronica, relieved to actually be in 
the process of aborting Brundle’s baby, comes out with a 
hearty laugh.
VERONICA
(LAUGHING)
Leave it on. This kid wouldn't look 
like them anyway.
Cheevers, relieved to see that he hasn’t blown a very 
delicate moment, smiles and reaches for the door.
CHEEVERS
(RELIEVED)
Great! OK. I’ll just get you a more 
appropriate costume and we’ll be on 
our way in no time ...
Cheevers leaves the room. There is an awkward, silent moment 
between Stathis and Veronica. And then...
WITHOUT WARNING, the immense floor-to-Cei1ing WINDOW of the 
operating room EXPLODES into the room! Shards of glass and 
pieces of window frame fly everywhere.
BRUNDLE hurtles into the room, the force of his entry 
carrying him crashing into the operating table which tips 
over and smashes to the floor.
Stathis stands frozen in the corner of the room, but Brundle 
ignores him. He wants Veronica.
Brundle finds Veronica cowering in the corner, blood 
trickling down her left temple from a glass cut, eyes wide in 
disbelief. Brundle scrambles to his feet, picks Veronica up 
and effortlessly tucks her under his arm.
Then, without the slightest acknowledgment of Stathis, he 
calmly steps out through the broken window and disappears, 
taking Veronica, who is too stunned to resist, with him.
Stathis manages to shake off his paralysis, runs to the 
window and tries to look out, but as he leans against a piece 
of window frame, he cuts himself on the minute fragments of 
jagged glass lodged in it. Stathis recoils with the pain, but 
still manages to catch a glimpse of Brundle, silhouetted in 
the moonlight, carrying Veronica over the rooftops.
82.
Now Cheevers whips open the door, folded hospital gown in 
hand. The room is a complete shambles. Stathis turns to meet 
his astonished gaze. All he can do is shrug.
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
67
67
We are with Brundle as he carries the terrified Veronica, 
over the rooftops. Finally he alights in a cozy little 
rooftop nook overlooking a park.
Brundle lays Veronica down on the slate of the rooftop.
His eyes are glistening, moist - are they full of tears?
He speaks with a voice even harsher and more metallic than 
before, but there is a strange, rhythmic catch in his voice 
which might be weeping.
BRUNDLE
Why did you want to kill Brundle? 
The baby will be all that’s left of 
the real Brundle. Please don’t kill 
me. Please don’t kill me.
VERONICA
I can’t have it. I’m afraid!
BRUNDLE
(RELENTLESS)
Have the baby. Let me live long 
enough to see the baby.
VERONICA
I can’t! I can’t!
BRUNDLE
(FLAT, EXPRESSIONLESS)
Too bad.
(INSCRUTABLE PAUSE)
Too bad.
INT. LAB - NIGHT
68
68
We are inside the darkened lab. There is a sharp "crack” from 
outside the door, which then slides open: someone has just 
broken in.
Stathis enters the lab with a crowbar in one hand and what 
looks like an abnormally large, slim attaché case in the 
other. A soft bag hangs from his shoulder by a webbed strap.
83.
Stathis switches on a small lamp and puts down the bag, the 
crowbar, and the case. He now opens the sleek plastic case to 
reveal a very expensive Italian over-and-under skeet shotgun 
- not really a great weapon but obviously the only one 
instantly accessible to him.
Stathis sits on the couch and calmly assembles the shotgun. 
He then breaks out a box of shells from the bag and loads 
each barrel of the gun - two shots only. The barrels are 
swivelled back into place and locked. The safety is slid to 
OFF.
Stathis gets up from the couch and, shotgun in hand, walks 
over to the metal crank which hangs from the main skylight. 
He cranks the skylight open wide.
Stathis now settles down to wait in the nearest chair - which 
happens to be the old steno chair in front of the computer 
keyboard. It doesn’t take Stathis long to notice the beige 
plastic box of discs on the table, and it takes no time at 
all for him to generate enough curiosity to open the box and 
flick on the computer’s master switch.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LAB - NIGHT

Stathis is deep into Brundle’s computer discs. We are close 
on the computer monitor as it plays back for us the computer-
graphics version of the disintegration of the cat and the 
monkey and their subsequent reintegration as the cat-monkey 
creature. As before, the following final words flash 
triumphantly on the screen:
FUSION SUCCESSFUL
RECEIVER TELEPOD 3
Stathis is confused.
CU the words "TELEPOD 3” flashing on the computer screen.
Stathis now switches to another disc whose title is "FUSION 
PROGRAM. He punches up "FUSION PROGRAM MENU," and finds 
listed: "BRUNDLEFLY PROJECT."
"BRUNDLEFLY PROJECT" is duly punched up, and it produces the 
following:
THE BRUNDLEFLY PROJECT
PROBLEM: TO REFINE GENETIC FUSION PROGRAM
84.
GOAL: TO DECREASE TO A MINIMUM THE PERCENTAGE
OF "FLY" IN BRUNDLEFLY
SOLUTION: THE FUSION BY GENE-SPLICING OF BRUNDLEFLY
WITH ONE OR MORE "PURE” HUMAN BEINGS
GENE-SPLICING METHODOLOGY
A. HARDWARE:
TELEPOD 1: TRANSMITTER OF SUBJECT A
TELEPOD 2: TRANSMITTER OF SUBJECT B
TELEPOD 3: RECEIVER FOR GENETICALLY-FUSED A-B COMBINATION 
SUBJECT
CU the words ”TELEPOD 3” on the screen.
Stathis gets up from the chair and takes a quick walk through 
the lab - shotgun always in hand - looking for this 
mysterious TELEPOD 3. He soon spots the THIRD TELEPOD, once 
again covered by the tarpaulin.
Stathis pulls away the tarp to reveal the third telepod.
It is clunkier and less tidy than the other two pods, but 
it’s basically the same machine. Stathis turns and begins to 
walk back to the computer.
BUT HE DOESN’T GET THERE, because BRUNDLE drops down on top 
of him from the skylight!
Stathis sprawls on the floor, but doesn’t let go of the 
shotgun. Brundle lands neatly on his feet and stands 
crouched, ready to do battle. Stathis swings the shotgun 
around towards Brundle, and Brundle leaps, grabs the barrel 
of the gun and holds it away from himself.
Stathis tries desperately to wrench the gun free, but Brundle 
is much too strong. Brundle grabs Stathis by the wrist with 
his other hideous hand. He slowly, contemptuously brings the 
wrist towards his mouth. As Stathis watches helplessly, 
Brundle’s ENTIRE FACE OPENS UP to reveal HIDEOUS FLY MOUTH 
PARTS! A HUGE FLY TONGUE unfolds and spurts milky, viscous 
vomit onto Stathis’s clenched fist.
Stathis screams as his fist dissolves into a dripping, 
simmering, bloody pulp. Near fainting, Stathis drops the 
shotgun. Brundles tongue retracts AND HIS FACE CLOSES AGAIN, 
leaving no trace that it had ever split open!
85.
Brundle reaches for it but Stathis manages to hook his foot 
over it. BRUNDLE’S TERRIBLE MAW OPENS AGAIN and more fluid 
spews out over Stathis’s foot. The shoe, the sock, the flesh, 
the bone, all bubble and dissolve and drop away, leaving 
nothing but a steaming, bloody, cauterized stump.
Brundle’s movements, his facial expressions, are completely 
dispassionate, insect-effective. He methodically begins to 
suck the liquifying, pulpy flesh back up into his crop, 
mercilessly probing what was Stathis’s foot with his 
metallic-green tubular tongue.
Stathis is past screaming now. He simply nods off, almost 
gently, into semi-consciousness.
Brundle’s face hovers like a bad dream over Stathis’s face. 
Stathis’s mouth is open, he is breathing deeply as though in 
the deepest kind of sleep; but his eyes are.
open, he seems to be aware on some praeter-conscious level. 
Brundle bends closer to Stathis, closer, inches away...
A voice shatters the moment, a voice which comes from behind 
and above Brundle.
VERONICA
(QUIETLY)
Don't kill him! If there's anything 
human left inside you, don't kill 
him!
Brundle turns to see Veronica peering down at him through the 
sky 1ight.
VERONICA
(ALMOST A WHISPER)
Please.
Brundle turns back to Stathis, who now curls up in the corner 
like a spider touched by a lit cigarette. Brundle hesitates, 
calculates. Then finally, HIS FACE CLOSES AGAIN and he leaves 
Stathis, gets up, swings up a support beam to the skylight 
and Veronica.
BRUNDLE
Help me. Help me. Help me to be 
human.
VERONICA
How?
86.
Brundle tucks Veronica under one arm and effortlessly swings 
back down into the lab with her. He leaves her in a corner 
and goes over to the computer. He is not really surprised to 
see that the computer has already been switched on and that 
the right disc is up.
Brundle reaches over to the controller and flips some 
switches. Operating lights come on in Telepod 1, then Telepod 
2, and then, Veronica notices with a start, in Telepod 3.
Brundle gestures towards the appropriate telepods.
BRUNDLE
I go there. You go there. We come 
apart, and then, we come together -
(INDICATING THIRD 
TELEPOD)
- there. You, and me, and the baby, 
together. We’ll be the ultimate 
family. A family of three, joined 
together in one body, more human 
than I am alone.
Veronica now realizes exactly what Brundle has in mind.
She begins to back away, edging towards the door.
VERONICA
Oh, no. You can't... you can’t mean 
that...
Without hesitation, Brundle leaps across the room and grabs 
her. Veronica screams in horror.
VERONICA
(SCREAMING)
No! No! I won’t do it!
Brundle starts to drag her towards the second telepod.
Veronica begins to fight Brundle. She smashes at him with her 
fists, she jams her hands up under his chin and pushes with 
all her might. AND HIS LOWER JAW COMES RIGHT OFF IN HER 
HANDS! Brundle releases her. She stares in disbelief at the 
dripping human lower jaw, complete with quivering lip, which 
she now holds in her hands. She looks back at Brundle, 
stunned, mesmerized. Where his jaw
was there are now vibrating, twitching insect mouth parts.
Veronica screams. With one sudden, vicious swipe of his claw-
hand across her face, Brundle drops Veronica as though she 
had been pole-axed, severing her scream in mid-air.
87.
Brundle’s tubular tongue is now completely exposed, and it 
stretches outwards and upwards, fusing with the other mouth 
and nose parts to form a true fly proboscis. He writhes and 
twists like a caterpillar weaving a cocoon as the end of his 
transformation is finally triggered off.
The bulges on his forehead split open and short antennae 
uncoil and spring erect. At the base of the antennae are 
several small, black, simple eyes, deep and unfathomable, 
like bullet holes in the skull. The dome-like swellings of 
his temples split open to reveal two damp masses of 
glistening black spheres, like mounds of caviar, which 
rapidly begin to swell and multiply until they have formed 
two huge insect compound eyes which swivel on extremely short 
stalks. Brundle’s own human eyes burst like raw eggs and 
dribble down his face as out of the sockets slide two 
clusters of short, bristly hairs.
There is a witness to Brundle’s transformation: Stathis has 
been edging towards his shotgun, inching his way along the 
floor, fighting the agony, blacking out for seconds at a time 
and recovering.
Brundle is now a completely non-human thing - yet he seems 
bent on completing his fusion project. Whether this is out of 
a sti11-1iving desire to regain some kind of humanity, or out 
of mere insect momentum, we can’t tell.
In either case, he picks up the unconscious Veronica and 
places her - is it gently or just fastidiously? - into 
Telepod 2 and closes the door.
CU - AUTOMATIC EXTERIOR LATCH OF TELEPOD 2 DOOR SLIDING HOME.
He goes back to the computer and sets it to time a countdown, 
which we see on the monitor:
COUNTDOWN TO FUSION
60 SECONDS
Now Brundle gets into Telepod 1 and swings the door shut 
behind him.
CU - AUTOMATIC EXTERIOR LATCH OF TELEPOD 1 DOOR SLIDING HOME.
This is Stathis’s cue. He glances at the monitor.
CU MONITOR - which reads:
COUNTDOWN TO FUSION
28 SECONDS
88.
Stathis struggles to his knees; then, using the shotgun as a 
crutch, he manages to stand erect. He limps over to Telepod 
2, unable to avoid noticing how frail and unreal Veronica 
looks, slumped in the corner of the telepod like a doll under 
glass.
Now Stathis props himself up against a support beam and 
raises the shotgun, resting the barrel on his truncated left 
forearm.
From inside Telepod 1, Brundle sees Stathis, understands his 
intention. Brundle throws himself against the door of his 
telepod, but it won’t move. He starts to slam his claw-hands 
against the glass like a pair of sledgehammers, but the glass 
is immensely strong.
CU MONITOR - which reads:
COUNTDOWN TO FUSION
13 SECONDS
Stathis is unsteady, has difficulty controlling his weapon.
Brundle continues to hammer at the glass - NOW WITH SOME 
SUCCESS, as the glass is beginning to craze in star­ shaped 
patterns under Brundle’s blows!
Stathis has now managed to draw a bead on his target -the 
THICK CLUSTER OF CABLES which connect Veronica’s telepod to 
the computer and to the lab's power supply.
CU MONITOR - which reads:
COUNTDOWN TO FUSION
5 SECONDS
STATHIS FIRES! The cables at the foot of Telepod 2 EXPLODE 
INTO A BALL OF SPARKS AND FLAME!
Brundle pounds insanely at the glass of his telepod and the 
GLASS FINALLY SHATTERS. Brundle reaches out of the telepod 
and slides open the latch. He swings open the door. He steps 
out of the telepod...
CU MONITOR - which flicks from 1 SECOND to:
COUNTDOWN TO FUSION
0 SECONDS
89.
An intense white light spills out of the open telepod door, 
enveloping Brundle - who has not quite managed to step 
completely free - AND THE FRONT THIRD OF THE POD ITSELF!
Brundle begins to disintegrate, AND SO DOES THE FRONT THIRD 
OF THE TELEPOD! Brundle and part of the telepod are 
scrupulously analysed and outlined on the monitor, and then 
they disappear both from the monitor and from Stathis’s 
sight.
Now ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TELEPOD ARE LEFT STANDING, edges 
jagged, wires hanging, as though its front third had been 
sliced off by a chain saw. The remains of Telepod 1, looking 
like some kind of alien ruin, slump sideways under their own, 
now-unsupported weight.
Stathis turns to Telepod 2 - and releases an audible sigh of 
relief when he sees that Veronica still lies there, 
untouched.
Suddenly, TELEPOD 3 IMPLODES, sucked in on itself as though a 
complete vacuum has suddenly appeared at its core.
Warily, apprehensively, Stathis limps over to the smoking 
rubble of Telepod 3, once again using the shotgun as a 
crutch. Now he stands, swaying unsteadily, in trepidation 
before the heap of rubble, searching for signs of Brundle. A 
beat, an then...
OUT OF THE SMOKE AND RUBBLE RISES A THING, a confused mass of 
insect and human flesh, metal, circuit boards, wires and 
glass - the result of the FUSION OF BRUNDLE AND TELEPOD 1.
Stathis staggers back.in horror.
The Brundle-Thing comes after him, dragging parts of its 
lower body along the floor, pieces of black insect flesh 
fused with electronic circuitry dropping off it as it comes, 
a hideous, raging, MORTALLY STRICKEN monstrosity.
Its claw-hands, which now stick out of its body at Crazy, 
asymmetrical angles, reach out for Stathis. Stathis twists 
away but falls crashing to the floor.
Stathis slides himself backwards along the floor with his 
good hand, his stump, his chin... anything. THE BRUNDLE-
THING’S MOUTH PARTS - now located somewhere in the middle of 
its chest - dribble steaming, corrosive vomit-drop.
Stathis now finds himself jammed into a corner. He has no 
place else to go. The Brundle-Thing's CLAW-FINGERS TREMBLE as 
it reaches out for Stathis. Is it trying to attack Stathis or 
is it reaching out for some kind, any kind of human contact? 
There is no way for us to know.
90.
The Brundle-Thing begins to go into a dying spasm, shaking, 
twitching, shuddering. From somewhere deep within its 
deformed body comes an unearthly whistling sigh, perhaps more 
an expression of release than pain.
Stathis finds himself sobbing uncontrollably as the Brundle-
Thing gives a last tremor and then is still.
Stathis crawls his way over to Telepod 2 and unlatches the 
hatch door. He works his way halfway into the pod so that he 
can stroke the hair of Veronica, who responds to
his touch and murmurs as she begins to regain consciousness.
STATHIS
(SOOTHING)
Ronnie, Ronnie, it’s OK. I'm here. 
We came through it. We came through 
it.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
INT. STATHIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Veronica is murmuring in her sleep. She's in bed. Stathis is 
beside her, caressing her. He has an artificial rubber left 
hand, which looks quite real at first glance. Their bedroom 
is very stylish and sumptuous.
STATHIS
(SOOTHING)
It's OK, darling. I'm here, 
everything's OK.
Veronica sits up. She is somehow disturbed; maybe it's only 
because she's still half in her dream. She looks down at her 
stomach. It's big. She's very pregnant.
VERONICA
(DISORIENTED)
It was that dream again! Brundle... 
Brundle’s baby was being born..
STATHIS
(PATTING HER TUMMY)
This baby is mine, remember? Yours 
and mine. The most horrible thing 
that can happen is that it'll look 
more like me than you.
Veronica lies back, dreamily.
VERONICA
91.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm awake now. It's 
OK.
Stathis smiles and kisses her. Despite what she says, 
Veronica is still disoriented, unsettled. She begins to sink 
back into her dream.
INT. VERONICA'S DREAM - DAY
71
71
Veronica dreams about a gorgeous CHRYSALIS - a butterfly’s 
cocoon - which resembles that of a Monarch butterfly. The 
chrysalis, a translucent jade-green, hangs from a leaf in a 
brightly surreal landscape.
The chrysalis begins to twist and turn as something inside it 
struggles to be born. Finally, a BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BABY WITH 
GOSSAMER, INSECT WINGS emerges. The baby clings to the 
chrysalis for a few moments, fanning its wings slowly until 
they dry.
Then the baby takes flight and disappears, LEAVING THE BURST 
AND SHRIVELLED CHRYSALIS BEHIND.

In her sleep, Veronica is now smiling serenely.
