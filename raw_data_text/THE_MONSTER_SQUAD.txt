EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

Ever been to Transylvania? Well, even if you haven’t, it 
looks nothing like the creepy, rotting landscape before us. 
That's because this is Transylvania circa Universal Pictures, 
1931.
WE PAN the crumbling tombstones of an ancient, dilapi­ dated 
GRAVEYARD... passing gnarled trees that look like claws; 
claws reaching reaching for a huge full moon...
THUNDER rumbles. Lightning CRACKS. Somewhere on the moors, a 
wolf HOWLS... and just in case the three tons of fog haven't 
sufficiently clued you, we:
SUPER THE LEGEND: THE CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS
TRANSYLVANIA, 1887
Mist-shrouded mountains loom down on us... until soon,
WE DISCERN a shape through the mist... because atop one of 
those mountains... is an ancient, crumbling BATTLEMENT with 
turret-openings looking down on us like empty, gaping eye 
sockets.
Boys and girls? Welcome to CASTLE DRACULA...
DISSOLVE:
INT. BOWELS OF CASTLE DRACULA - DEAD OF NIGHT

12th century stone arches. Mist. Rats, SQUEAKING and 
scampering across the floor. Armadillos in the shadows of 
COFFINS...
That's right, coffins. Three of them.
AS THE CAMERA GLIDES ACROSS the stone floor... one of the 
coffins BEGINS TO OPEN... and we catch a glimpse of a chalk-
white hand at its edge, as...
One of the OTHER coffins begins openings... CREEEEAAAAK... 
and another hand, female, from inside, AS WE MOVE TO the 
third coffin, on which is emblazoned a finely-wrought "gold 
crest...
2.
And right when we think THAT coffin, is going to open, WE 
CRANE UP... TO THE CEILING of this dank chamber and there, in 
the cobwebbed shadows, are a million glit­ tering lights, like 
diamonds, except what they actu­ ally are is a million EYES, 
because the ceiling is covered with disgusting BATS, all 
suspended upside down, and don't ask WHAT KIND of bats, 
because you know better than that, now don't you?
SERIES OF SHOTS
exploring the full range of bat slumber, AS THEY twitch, and 
gibber, and do bat things, and trust us, rodent fans will be 
camping out next to the theater, but now SOMETHING ELSE is 
happening...
Because WE SEE that slowly, with increasing FERVOR, the bats 
are becoming AGITATED, chittering and screeching, then 
flapping their wings in a growing frenzy, shrieking and 
flapping AWAY FROM
A PARTICULAR BAT
In the center. A real beauty, too, with eyes brilliant 
pinpoints of red, and then we notice, amidst the thunder and 
keening of terrified bats, that this one specific bat... is 
GROWING.
He vibrates and twitches, stretches and distends, and you 
better close your eyes here because, get this, he starts to 
SPLIT OPEN, becoming longer, and bigger, and yes, undeniably 
more HUMAN, as the OTHER BATS REALLY go nuts now, AND —
ON CELLAR FLOOR A PAIR OF FEET.
Naked, HUMAN feet, HIT THE FLOOR with a SLAP, and a naked 
human MAN rises slowly. Tall, lean, seemingly unaffected by 
the STORM of bats screeching and flapping all around him...
For the record: VLAD THE IMPALER was a Romanian prince whose 
hobby was violent murder... but that was hundreds of years 
ago. NOW he's your basic, run-of-the-mill, undead 
personification of evil. No blood in his face.
Plenty in his eyes.
They are eyes you NEVER want to look directly into.
He moves across the cellar... past the other two coffins 
which are OPEN and EMPTY... to an iron torch-holder with a 
pressed tuxedo on a hanger. He reaches for a long black 
cape...

Now fully dressed, the Dark Prince strolls the moors, basking 
in the death and decay around him. He STOPS suddenly — senses 
pricked — fixated on TWO RED EYES glowing in the darkness, 
accompanied by a low, guttural GROWLING...
And THAT'S WHEN a huge WOLF LEAPS SNARLING from the bushes — 
and proceeds to lick the man's face. He scratches behind the 
wolf's ears, and they go off side by side toward the 
swamps...
FURTHER ON
The Dark Prince stops. Cocks his head to one side.
Listening. Cautious. Beside him, the wolf GROWLS. A pause.
Then a shotgun ROARS in the night and the wolf twists and 
lands on the ground in a heap as
AN AGED, HAUNTED-LOOKING MAN
steps forward. He looks suspiciously like actor Peter 
Cushing, but is, in fact ABRAHAM VAN HELSING.
VAN HELSING
Now.
The bushes behind him explode — sudden activity all around 
him — MEN shouting, brandishing knives and guns.
They swarm around the struggling, SCREAMING man/bat who 
proceeds to HURL THEM AWAY with incredible power as fast as 
they come.
The men hold him down as Van Helsing steps forward with a 
stake and mallet. He puts the stake to the Dark Prince's 
heart — RAISES the mallet —
VAN HELSING
Auf Wiedersehen, Count Dracula.
And POUNDS THAT SUCKER home so hard YOU feel it.
The VAMPIRE SCREAMS. Blood bubbles from his mouth.
Van Helsing turns to KARL, a short, muscular man with a dazed 
expression. He wipes the sweat and blood from his face.
VAN HELSING
Krueger. The wagon. There's not 
much time...

A CARRIAGE led by four horses RUMBLES PAST CAMERA... and 
toward the castle... which looms in the distance.

TWO of Van Helsing’s HENCHMEN light a bundle of dynamite, 
toss it at the front gate of the castle, and promptly run for 
all their worth, AS —
KA - BOOM! The ancient gating BLASTS into a million shards, 
showering debris AT CAMERA —
The HORSEMAN CRACKS HIS WHIP! And VAN HELSING AND HIS MEN 
charge across the bridge with hunting dogs on reins.
Torches lit, guns drawn, running full out because there is NO 
TIME TO LOSE...
INT. CASTLE GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Stone arches a mile in the air. Carved gargoyles.
Ancient debris littering the stone floor.
A FEMALE VAMPIRE feasts on a dead possum. She hears HOOF­ 
BEATS, looks UP, as —
The huge entrance doors EXPLODE, SPLINTERS FLYING, remains 
KICKED OFF THEIR HINGES as men rush in BLASTING AWAY with 
shotguns. VAN HELSING BARRELS INTO VIEW with a sleek 
crossbow.
THE VAMPIRE BRIDE drops her dinner, and goes for Van 
Helsing’s throat, hissing and spitting, and someone better 
remind him he's supposed to be scared, 'cause he doesn't even 
blink, he simply loads a wooden stake into the crossbow and 
fires, BAM — !
He steps over the corpse, runs a nervous hand through his 
hair. Grim. Determined. TWO of his MEN cross the chamber to a 
huge, tattered tapestry hanging between staircases. Van 
Helsing nods to the men... who tug it loose. It falls to the 
floor —
REVEALING a creepy STONE ALTAR guarded by a GRINNING 
SKELETON... Van Helsing sucks in his breath because there, 
atop the altar —
— is... The AMULET.
5.
Which amulet, you ask? Why, the ancient, intricately carved 
metal amulet which even now seems to PULSE with a life of its 
own..- Yeah, THAT amulet.
Van Helsing looks at his pocket-watch. Almost mid­ night.
VAN HELSING
Three minutes. The girl. Now.
The amulet flickers...throbs with COLOR... as Van Helsing 
unrolls a piece of ancient, YELLOW PARCHMENT covered with 
Gothic German lettering. He turns —
AS A BEAUTIFUL PEASANT GIRL is ushered into the room. Did I 
say ushered? I meant shoved....
VAN HELSING
Let's hurry a bit, shall we?
The amulet GLOWS...

KARL is still outside in the WOODS surrounding the castle, 
left to guard the wagons... grumbling, tossing gear into a 
carriage.
Around him the wind picks up, CLOUDS roll in... Dark.
Ominous. Lightning FLICKERS... causing Karl to SHIVER, and as 
he turns...
A FEMALE VAMPIRE strides calmly out of the woods... white, 
blood-spattered gown... fish-white skin and dripping fangs.
Karl gasps in shock... and wastes no time. He grabs a 
crossbow, loads a wood stake and FIRES — ! GLITCH.
One dead vampire... which would be swell... IF she'd been 
alone.
She wasn't.
ANOTHER VAMPIRE grabs Karl from behind. He SCREAMS, loads 
another stake and BAM — ! Another one bites the dust... 
Except, just then, LIGHTNING flashes yet again...
And we see that he is SURROUNDED by three more female 
vampires... Moving in. Circling. Ever have one of those days 
when there's just too darn many female vampires?
6.
He fires a stake, BAM — ! A vampire pitches over dead... 
Fires another, BAM — ! This is getting gross... Reaches for 
another stake... and guess what?
There aren't any.
Karl is slightly upset. He starts ripping open bags, plowing 
through supplies, and the last vampire bride is practically 
on top of him, and where the heck did he leave those stakes, 
for Chrissakes? — and she's getting CLOSER — so what does he 
do?
He does what you or I would do. The only thing he CAN do: he 
reaches into the carriage and pulls the stake out of 
Dracula's corpse. Ooops.
BAM— ! The last female vampire hits the dirt... and Karl 
heaves a sigh of relief, and leans back against the carriage, 
and that's when Dracula SITS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM and we
SLAM-CUT TO:
INT. CASTLE GRAND HALL - AS BEFORE

Now things are REALLY moving. The wind is blowing some­ thing 
FIERCE, while at the altar the PEASANT GIRL stands wearing a 
ceremonial ROBE, reciting ALOUD from the parch­ ment scroll.
THE AMULET starts glowing even brighter... and now the wind 
is shrieking, and stone starts to CLATTER down from above... 
And the floor BUCKLES, and Van Helsing sweats, cause NOW he's 
afraid, you don’t need to remind him, and suddenly someone 
YELLS:
HENCHMAN
Dr. Van Helsing!
AS A ROTTING HAND BLASTS up through the floor — and ANOTHER —
And yet ANOTHER — as the room begins to swarm with living 
CORPSES, while the wind is positively SCREAMING in the 
turrets...
And so it's a pretty lousy time for the peasant girl to get 
cold feet, and yet: SHE STOPS READING, too afraid to go on — 
Van Helsing GRABS her roughly and says:
VAN HELSING
READ, OR WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.
Corpses crawl up through the floor. Thunder. Lightning.
7.
Wind. A HURRICANE of sound, a deafening crescendo, and the 
peasant girl takes a deep breath, and reads the scroll’s 
FINAL LINE:
PEASANT GIRL
"Bitte, tuen sie uns nicht weh."
At which point, my friends, all Hell breaks loose.
THE AMULET explodes with color and light —
And suddenly A CRACK appears in mid-air... a blinding flash 
of ENERGY which spirals faster... and faster... faster still, 
like an ENERGY WHIRLPOOL... Sucking everything in the room 
toward it.
Van Helsing. His men. The corpses.
ONE OF THE DEAD clutches at Van Helsing and drags him to the 
floor... Now they are both sucked toward the whirlpool, 
kicking and screaming...
One of Van Helsing's henchmen literally FLIES THROUGH THE AIR 
and disappears into the vortex —
And Van Helsing is still locked in a death-struggle with the 
howling creature... being sucked head over heels toward the 
energy field, toward his doom, and as the sound reaches a 
DEAFENING CRESCENDO, as we have absolutely no fucking idea 
what is going on except it's very LOUD and very BRIGHT, we 
SUDDENLY
CUT TO BLACK :

Hooray, SCHOOL'S OUT! The sun shines, birds sing, and KIDS 
GALORE EXODUS out of Curt Siodmak Elementary School.
We're talking bikes, basketballs, PeeChee folders, skate­ 
boards, laughing, yelling, and NOTHING remotely SCARY in the 
least.
CAMERA CRANES DOWN through the trees, past pig-tailed 
beauties and booger-eating geeks... all the way to a WINDOW 
with open Venetian blinds. We suddenly become DEPRESSED. Why? 
Because:

MR. METZGER, a stern, silly-looking man, sits at his desk 
across from one PATRICK RHODES: sincere, impetuous, soon to 
be a hero, only right now he's in TROUBLE...
MR. METZGER
Mr. Rhodes.
PATRICK
Patrick.
MR. METZGER
Patrick. Do you see this file 
folder?
PATRICK
Yes, sir.
MR. METZGER
Do you see how the edges are folded 
back? There's a term for that. It's 
called dog-eared.
PATRICK
Yeah, my comics get that way 
sometimes. Maybe if you put it 
under a heavy object like —
MR. METZGER
Patrick.
PATRICK
Dog-eared. Right. Gotcha.
MR. METZGER
And for something to BECOME dog­ 
eared., it has to be handled. Am I 
right?
PATRICK
I guess. I mean... unless you 
dropped it and it bent. I guess you 
didn't drop it.
MR. METZGER
No, Patrick. If I dropped it, it 
might spill, and the floor would be 
covered with discipline reports. 
Lots of them. And some wonderful 
artwork as well.
(removes a page)
I'm sorry, this is...?
9.
A YOUNG VOICE ANSWERS from offscreen —
VOICE
Wolfman... That's the Wolfman.
-- as SEAN CRENSHAW is ushered into the office. Spill of dark 
hair, a T-shirt which says STEPHEN KING RULES.
Sean is a born leader. Too bad he looks like a nerd.
MR. METZGER
Mr. Crenshaw. Delighted you could 
join us.
He pulls out another FOLDER and drops it on his desk. It is 
even thicker than Patrick's. Ouch. Sean sits beside Patrick.
PATRICK
Your file has dog ears.
MR. METZGER
Patrick and I were just this... 
preoccupation you boys seem to have 
during Mrs. Carlsen's science 
class. A preoccupation with... 
monsters? Any thoughts?
Sean shifts nervously. Shrugs.
SEAN
I dunno. I just think they're cool, 
I mean, me and Patrick even started 
a monster club.
MR. METZGER
A monster club.
PATRICK
Can I just say something here? I 
mean, Mrs. Carlsen is fine and all, 
and the other kids kinda laugh at 
that moustache she has but I NEVER 
do, even when it's really hard 
'cause when she turns sideways the 
hair sticks out and she looks like 
a cat, but I never call her Meow 
Mix like the other guys, I swear to 
God, cause I like her, I mean —
MR. METZGER
Mr. Rhodes, what are you trying to 
say?
SEAN
10.
Um, I think he means, sir, that we 
both LIKE Mrs. Carlsen's science 
class, but... sometimes it gets... 
kinda... you know...
(Patrick nods)
... boring. So he draws, I write 
stories.
MR. METZGER
Yes, I believe this is one of 
yours...
(reads)
"Beast With No Head Meets Sand 
Monster..." I assume Sand Monster 
wins?
SEAN
Uh, no, sir. Beast With No Head. 
Shoots him with a flamethrower and 
turns him into glass.
Mr. Metzger nods. Sighs. And then, he abruptly STANDS, walks 
around the desk... and launches into the following 
CONDESCENDING speech:
MR. METZGER
Boys... I hear you. I was a kid 
once. I thought monsters were 
"cool". And maybe... gosh, maybe 
I'm just a big kid, because Sean, 
Patrick: I think science is "cool". 
I DIG it, man.
The boys exchange glances, swallow hard: okay, the guy's 
flipping out, let's stay calm.
MR. METZGER
Now I'm sure that both of you know 
a great deal about monsters. That’s 
not the issue here. The issue is...
(beat)
Science is real. Monsters are not.
Sean clears his throat.
SEAN
We don’t know that.
SLAM CUT TO:
A HIDEOUS APPARITION RISES INTO FRAME — UGLY, DISGUSTING,
a nightmare Of living horror! It is, of course:

SEAN AND PATRICK
— Mrs. Carlsen.
They weren't lying. Her head is undeniably cat-like.
She looks daggers at them as they come out of the prin­ 
cipal's office:
INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR

A locker SLAMS. Sean makes soft MEWING noises.
PATRICK
She's married, Sean. Some guy 
KISSES her.
(Sean shakes his head)
I mean, a priest said, "I pro­ 
nounce you man and wife" and it was 
OKAY with him??
SEAN
Maybe he works for the SPCA.
(beat)
Man, can you BELIEVE Mr. Metzger?
PATRICK
Tell me about it! Before you came 
in he was putting his hands on me 
and patting my shoulder and stuff — 
the guy was fully mo-ing out.
(sniffs his shirt)
I smell like the 1940's.
SEAN
How come when they send you to 
school, they don't tell you about 
homos and people with cat heads?
PATRICK
We should write the School 
District.
SEAN
Dear School District: Mrs. Carl­ sen 
says monsters are stupid, and 
besides she has a cat head. What 
should I do. Signed, student.
PATRICK
Dear Student: Become a homo and go 
but with Mr. Metzger.
(they laugh)
God, I wish it was Friday.
12.
SEAN
It is Friday.
PATRICK
Only FAIRIES grant wishes.
SEAN
(looking around)
Hey, where's the Fat Kid?
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
12
12
Enter FAT KID. We love him instantly: you have to love 
someone who tries so hard to be liked and fails so 
spectacularly.
He looks up from a) reading a comic book, b) chewing an 
Almond Joy bar, and c) pulling his underwear out of his butt, 
to SEE:
That his path is now blocked by two MEAN KIDS, E.J. and 
DEREK. Not that you won't notice, but they are sadistic 
little turds. They will grow up, get bald, and sell you a 
used car.
E. J.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
and welcome to our show. Tonight's 
ques­tion: What makes Fat Kid fat? 
Fat Kid?
FAT KID
Get outa here, E.J.
E. J.
"Get outa here, E.J." Hmmm. Not a 
good answer.
DEREK
Nope. Doesn't make any sense.
E.J.
Let's go to our man in the street. 
Derek.
DEREK
Hi, I'm Derek and I'm in the 
street, where Fat Kid is blocking 
traffic. Fat Kid: Can't you stop 
eating?
E.J.
13.
Is it true you want to look like a 
retard?
DEREK
You ate beans for lunch. Is it true 
the army plans to use you in fart 
warfare, or is it just a rumor?
Finally, Fat Kid can take no more —
FAT KID
Look, just — BUG OFF!
|E.J.
Ooooh, I'm so scared, I wet my 
pants.
FAT KID
Look, I have a glandular problem, 
okay? At least I don't have a... 
STUPIDITY problem.
Everything STOPS. A pause.
E.J.
What'ja say? Huh?
(shoves Fat Kid lamely)
What'ja say, Fat Kid?
FAT KID
(quietly)
My name's Horace.
E.J. and Derek are amused by this. E.J. takes the comic book 
from Fat Kid, who stands there sweating, afraid, as E.J. 
slowly TEARS THE COMIC down the middle.
E.J.
Ooops. Sorry, Fat Kid, I tore it. 
Guess I must have a stupid­ ity 
problem.
Struggling against tears, Fat Kid mumbles something.
E.J.
What d'you say? Huh? Faggot?
FAT KID
(gulp)
... I said you're an asshole.
Ever wish you hadn’t said something?
14.
E.J. SHOVES Fat Kid. .Hard. In the gut. Fat Kid doubles over 
like a deflated balloon, but E.J. isn’t finished; he POUNCES 
on him, laying punches into him, except right then, without 
warning —
THERE IS A SCREECH OF RUBBER... and a bike tire skids to a 
halt. E.J. spins around, annoyed... stops dead. The blood 
drains from his face... Why?
Because RUDY HALLORAN has just arrived.
Everyone freezes... RUDY strikes a match off his sneaker, 
slowly raises it — WE PAN up with his hand... past pegged 
jeans... sleeveless T-shirt... to a dangling cigarette, which 
the match promptly lights....
And through a cloud of smoke we get our first good look at 
just what COOL is all about: Picture actor Mickey Rourke. Now 
make him a junior high shop major, 13 years old. That's Rudy.
Derek boogies. Fast. E.J. releases Fat Kid, rises.
E.J.
Hey, Rudy.
RUDY
(nods)
E.J.
(drags on the smoke)
See you know my friend Horace.
(to Fat Kid)
You okay?
Fat Kid nods weakly, still lying doubled over.
E.J.
Listen, Rudy —
RUDY
(points)
Ssshh. Dropped your candy bar.
E.J.
Uh uh, it's his.
RUDY
Yours now.
E.J.
I won’t pick on him Rudy, I 
promise... But —
RUDY
Eat up... we'll call it a day.
15.
Rudy is deadly calm. E.J. reaches down, picks up the candy 
bar... IT IS COVERED with dirt and fuzz and maybe even 
(choke) dogshit. Rudy puffs on his smoke.
On E.J.'s big, nauseating bite, we discretely

SUBURBIA hasn't set in here yet. Shady oak trees, houses 
built in the 20's and 30's, nice lawns, and mild-mannered 
Dads hopelessly mangling K-Mart garage door openers.
SEAN
Wolfman can NOT drive a car!
SEAN AND PATRICK head home from school/ backpacks across 
their shoulders, Patrick on his skateboard. Dogging their 
steps is an eight year-old dazzler named PHOEBE... Sean’s 
little sister.
PATRICK
All's I'm saying is, he could if he 
had to.
SEAN
Could not.
PATRICK
Could so.
SEAN
Could not, DORK.
PATRICK
I know you are, but what am I?
SEAN
Dork.
PATRICK
I know you are, but what am I?
As Phoebe walks, she strips a daisy of its petals one by one, 
chanting the age-old litany:
PHOEBE
He loves me, he loves me not... He 
loves me, he loves me not...
SEAN
(exasperated)
16.
Phoebe, would you cut it out? 
That's incredibly immature.
- Being a little sister, she naturally continues.
SEAN
Look, Wolfman is the same as a 
wolf, okay? He doesn't... go to 
work, he's not like a guy.
PATRICK
What d'you mean? He walks around, 
he wears pants —
(CONTINUED )
SEAN
THAT'S because those movies were 
made in the 140s and he HAD to wear 
pants so you wouldn't see his... 
his wolf-dork.
PATRICK
Wolf-dork?
Phoebe YELPS, clutches Sean's arm.
PHOEBE
YOU GUYS1
(points)
I saw him! He was watching us.
SEAN
Who?
PHOEBE
(scared whisper)
Scary German Guy...
Sean and Patrick follow her gaze. They SEE:
A HOUSE, not unlike all the others, except less well-kept.
Peeling paint. Brownish curtains. Weeds. You just KNOW it 
smells inside. The kids MOVE CAUTIOUSLY past the house.
PATRICK
That guy gives me the creeps.
SEAN
Lighten up. It's just some old guy 
on welfare.
PATRICK
Maybe he's a German spy.
17.
SEAN
Good one. We're not even at war 
with Germany, we're at war with 
Vietnam.
PATRICK
Nuh uh.
SEAN
Uh huh. It's in RAMBO.
(CONTINUED )
The three of them look back at the house as they continue 
walking forward... not looking where they're going. They walk 
smack-dab into —
FAT KID
You guys missed it!
WE SEE Rudy on his bike, several paces behind Fat Kid.
He takes off a pair of Ray-bans.
FAT KID
Rudy saved my life, so I said he 
could be in the monster club, can 
he?
Sean and Patrick eye Rudy. Rudy eyes them back. The monster 
club huddles.
PATRICK
Sean, he's in Junior High.
PHOEBE
I heard he killed his dad.
FAT KID
Butt out, Phoebe.
PHOEBE
Make me, Fat Kid.
FAT KID
My name's Horace.
PHOEBE
Your parents are so mean,
(goes back to)
Loves me, loves me not...
Fat Kid grabs her flower.
FAT KID
18.
He thinks you're a fart, he thinks 
you're a turd. THERE! He thinks 
you're a turd.
Phoebe backs off, pouting sadly. It is so adorable, you want 
to fall down and die.
SEAN
Okay. We should let him in... On 
ONE condition.
They all exchange looks. A beat.
SEAN/PATRICK/FAT KID
Monster test.
They MOVE OFF down the sidewalk, leaving Phoebe behind, 
staring mesmorized at the house of the legendary Scary German 
Guy. Her eyes suddenly WIDEN WITH HORROR, because:
Staring from a window, is the weathered old face of SCARY 
GERMAN GUY himself, peering through the curtains, grinning 
with cracked, yellow teeth... Heh heh, kiddies...
Phoebe manages to uproot her frozen feet and dash off down 
the street —
SCARY GERMAN GUY stares after her, shakes his head, draws the 
curtains and as he does, WE do a George Lucas style

Dennis looks out at an endless landscape of swampland.
Mike reads a comic book. A transistor radio plays "Monster 
Mash".
DENNIS

gum)

I'm depressed.
MIKE
What are you depressed about?
DENNIS
Our passengers are all dead.
MIKE
So?
(CONTINUED )
DENNIS
Whaddya mean, "So?" They're dead, I 
should have a party?
MIKE
It's not your fault. Besides, do 
they complain? Do they get airsick? 
Do they ask for more of the little 
almond things?
DENNIS
(thinks it over)
You're right. This job is great. 
I'm very happy.
MIKE
That's the spirit.
DENNIS
I'm gonna buy a puppy.
MIKE
(calls over his shoulder)
You hear that, guys? My pal's 
buying a PUPPY!
(nothing but silence)
No, but seriously, I just flew in 
from New York, CRAZY town, CRAZY 
town.

No sense of humor.
DENNIS
Dead crowd.
MIKE
Ouch.
He unwraps another stick of gum, just as from the rear 
compartment — there is a very distinct THUMP. Mike and Dennis 
exchange looks.

DENNIS
I thought they were dead.
MIKE
They are. You must be really funny.
DENNIS
I'm gonna check it out.

16
16
Here we go, boys and girls: DENNIS opens the hatchway and 
steps into the rear compartment... shuts the hatch.
CLANG.
Looks around: the cargo hold is filled with WOODEN CRATES... 
about six feet long by three feet wide, some of them bearing 
the legend "CADAVERS - STORE AT REDUCED TEMPERATURE".
One PARTICULAR CRATE seems larger and older than the rest. On 
its side, the stenciled word "BAVARIA", and another word, 
this one harder to read, but as Dennis approaches, we make 
out the letters: F-R-A-N-K-E... Gulp.
Dennis leans over the crate, brushes away the dust, and the 
suspense mounts until, just as he straightens up - WE HEAR 
ANOTHER THUMP. Dennis jumps a foot. Then frowns, puzzled... 
because, get this, the THUMP is coming from OUTSIDE THE 
PLANE.
Like any good B-movie extra, Dennis turns to the cargo door, 
shines his flashlight on it, and...
IT FLINGS OPEN... a SCREAM OF WIND... ROARING turbines... and
Dennis leans forward to have a look --
And that's when A BIG OLD BAT comes shrieking into his face.
Okay. Pry yourself off the ceiling, it was a cheap scare.
THE BAT flutters behind a stack of crates... Dennis mutters, 
pissed off, rummages around and finally comes up with a 
wicked-looking ALLEN WRENCH.­
21.
He grins, ready to kick ass, turns around — and with­ out 
warning, A HAND SLAPS HIM BACKWARD against the bulkhead. He 
collapses in a heap. Yep, you guessed it — COUNT DRACULA 
stands over his unconscious form. Tuxedo. Cape. A cane with a 
GOLDEN WOLF'S HEAD at its tip.
He crosses to the big crate, bends over it, face in shadow... 
grips the edge and begins with SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH, to pry 
open the lid. His eyes glow BLOOD RED with determination....
There is a SCRAPING NOISE behind Dracula. He stops.
Turns. DENNIS is sitting up. Ragged cut across his forehead, 
but he's still conscious... and he's got hold of a steel 
LEVER.
He throws it down.
Stuff happens. First, the plane's BOMB BAY doors fall open 
with a CRASH OF GEARS — and the CRATE plummets headlong into 
open space.
Second: Dracula doesn't.
Instead he hovers in mid-air over where the floor USED
to be. Holy shit... He SNARLS at Dennis, eyes blood red — and 
HIDEOUS WINGS sprout through his clothing.
Dennis chokes in fear.
And Dracula drops like a stone. Out of the plane,
plunging into airspace. DENNIS lunges forward, peers over the 
edge... The wind whips his hair, and his eyes widen with 
SHOCK —
DENNIS' POV (MATTE SHOT)
Below us is an endless stretch of twilight swamp. THE CRATE 
is still falling, end over end... And DRACULA, too, plummets 
headfirst, changing before our eyes into a disgusting VAMPIRE 
BAT. Transformation in free-fall, we're talking awesome... 
DRACULA'S CAPE is torn free by the wind. It flutters off 
toward the horizon, where the FULL MOON is just now 
ascending....

The huge crate PLUNGES through the trees and lands with a 
mighty KER-SPLASH in the middle of the swamp... where it 
sinks below the surface without a trace...

WE MOVE TO... a mossy cypress tree. A BAT hangs from a branch 
upside down. Its eyes GLOW blood red...

DRACULA'S CAPE is still fluttering on the breeze... descends

WE CLOSE ON RUDY, looking out an opening with a pair of 
binoculars.
RUDY
You've gotta be kidding me...
A RUDY'S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 16 YEAR-OLD BLONDE YOU EVER SAW
IN YOUR LIFE rises from a swimming pool next door.

SEAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
This is a monster test, come on, 
it's important! Second way to kill 
a vampire.
Male adolescent paradise. Comic books, toys, magazines, 
posters, movie stills... All the Aurora monster models, 
including Forgotten Prisoner of Castle Mare (who isn't really 
a monster, but hell with it).
RUDY
I give up. Daylight?
And meet two more members of our club: EUGENE, 5, doesn't say 
much, is adorable. And then there's PETE THE DOG. Pete is 
Eugene's constant companion, and to say he's cute is to say 
Lake Michigan is a trifle damp.
FAT KID
SUN light.
PATRICK
Fat Kid? What OTHER kind of light 
is there during the day?!
Eugene tries to eat a candy bar, Pete paws at his arm.
Eugene ignores him, Pete moves in with his NOSE. Eugene holds 
the candy over his head.
EUGENE
Go 'way, Pete.
Pete is a dog: this advice makes no sense. He barrels in and 
gobbles the candy, drenches Eugene with his tongue.
WE FINALLY REST ON the panel of questioners: Sean, Patrick 
and fat Kid. A candle is lit, the lighting dim, like a 
seance. We're talking real ritual stuff here.
PATRICK
Okay. Question Two. Is Frankenstein 
the name of the monster, or the guy 
who made him?
RUDY
The guy.
SEAN
Right.
There is a KNOCK On the trap door. Sean opens it to REVEAL 
PHOEBE, hanging on the rope swing outside. There is a 
stencilled sign on the door: "NO GIRLS ALLOWED".

SEAN
Can't you read?
PHOEBE
Mom says you have to let me in the 
club or else it's prescription.
SEAN

Silver bullet?
FAT KID
And...?
RUDY
That's it. Shoot him with a silver 
bullet.
PATRICK
Nuh-uh. Sorry, Rudy.
RUDY

cigarette)
No sweat. What's the other way?
(CONTINUED )
Patrick and Fat Kid look at each other.
SEAN
What?
RUDY

Rudy just looks at them. The "experts" shift uncomfortably.

PATRICK

FAT KID

SEAN
Falling out a window — onto a bomb?
Rudy shakes his head.

EMILY
Wash up for dinner, guys.
They head for the door. Sean sees something on the kitchen 
table and stops: an old, crumbling BOOK.
SEAN
What's this, Mom?
EMILY
26.
Huh? Oh. I found that for you at 
Jane Birge's garage sale today. 
Says it came from that old house 
out on Shadowbrook Road...
Phoebe crowds next to Sean as he takes the book and examines 
it. The cover is ancient, with faded gold letters: ABRAHAM 
VAN HELSING. Sean's eyes go wide.
SEAN
Holy sit— urn, cow. Mom, do you 
know who wrote this?
EMILY
Van Helsing something. He's the one 
who fights Godzilla, right?
SEAN
Dracula, Mom.
EMILY
Oh. Which is the really tall one?
SEAN

God, thanks, Mom, this is great.

This is German.
EMILY
Well, take classes and you'll be 
able to read it.
SEAN
Cute, Mom.
He exits, as Phoebe begins to dance around her mother.
PHOEBE
Look, Mommy, I'm dancing to the 
news.
Unfortunately, she also tries to sing to the news, and 
whereas the T.V. ANNOUNCER says something like:
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
...The mummy of Egyptian Pharoah 
Kantanka-Ra, featured in the City 
Museum for a two week exhibition, 
beginning tomorrow...
Phoebe sings something like:
27.
PHOEBE
The MUM. MUMMY-MUMMY-MUM. Katanka. 
TANKA-TANKA-TANK!
Outside the window we see the neighbors moving back ease. Not 
really, but it's that annoying.
EMILY
Phoebe, I'm listening to that. Go 
wash up. Isn't your show on?
PHOEBE
PTA says I can't watch that Show.
EMILY
They do, huh?
PHOEBE
Too much sex.
EMILY
Watch the show.
(Under her breath)
We could use a little sex in this 
house.
Phoebe goes into the living room. Emily sighs... and her eyes 
stray to a PHOTOGRAPH on the wall: the two children. Herself. 
Her husband DEL, in a spanking new POLICE Uniform. Shiny 
badge.
Something happens in Emily's eyes; a surrender to despair. 
The kitchen is a mess. she picks up the flower stem which 
Phoebe left on the counter...

Not really. Shoot anybody today?
DEL
'Fraid not. Still may if you don't 
wash up for dinner.
SEAN
Okay.
He stands there.
DEL
What's on your mind?
SEAN
Well, some of the guys and me, we 
were maybe gonna go see Groundhog 
Day Part 12 tonight if it's okay 
with you, is it okay please say 
yes?
DEL
Ouch. We got a problem.
SEAN
No way.
DEL
29.
Yes way. I have to go out with your 
mother tonight, and you got a 
certain seven year-old sister who 
needs babysitting. Sorry 'bout 
that.
SEAN
Dad, I've been waiting all year to 
see this movie!
DEL
Easy, pal. It's only a movie. Look, 
tomorrow night I'll get home early 
and you and I will go see Groundhog 
Day. Fair?
SEAN
Tomorrow? Dad, tomorrow I'll know 
everything, the guys'll blab the 
entire plot! Son. Trust me. There 
ain't —
SEAN
Isn't.
DEL
— isn't any plot, there’s a bozo 
with an axe and anyway, I thought 
they killed him in the last one.
SEAN
Dad, you can't kill him, he keeps 
coming BACK.
DELL
Well maybe, just maybe, someone 
should get a clue, and freeze him 
or make friends with him or some­ 
thing, 'cause when they kill him 
all he does is keep showing up and 
you say Dad, give me five bucks and 
no, I can't babysit my only sister 
because this time they cut off his 
head and send it to Norway, and 
isn't that a great plot? See what 
I'm saying?
SEAN
Dad, all I want to do is see a 
stupid movie.
DEL
Well, you can't. You're 
babysitting.

A BEEFY COP is trying to restrain a DESPERATE-LOOKING MAN 
with a five-day beard and big hollows under his eyes.
The man is becoming increasingly PANICKED:
32.
DESPERATE MAN
I'm tellin' ya, you gotta lock me 
up. Put me in a cage.
BEEFY COP
Buddy, I'd like nothing better, 
just hold your pants on...
The OTHER COPS arrive, flanking the struggling man.
DESPERATE MAN
You don't understand, you've GOTTA 
HURRY, I can't resist for long...
BEEFY COP
Yeah, well try real hard, okay?
DESPERATE MAN
Oh, God, IT HURTS!

BEEFY COP
Hey, ladies, how about helping me 
book this bozo —
DESPERATE MAN
Yes, BOOK ME! You gotta put me away 
NOW —
A sound of pain excapes his throat, and HIS HEAD WHIPS 
AROUND, staring out a window. And there, wouldn't you know 
it, is the FULL MOON, peeking from behind a cloud bank...
BEEFY COP
Gimmee a nightstick, I can't — 
JESUS!
The desperate man wrenches free. SUPERHUMAN strength.

In the blink of an eye he grabs a GUN from the cop's holster. 
SCREAMS.
DESPERATE MAN

cops dive for cover as — A ROOKIE, scared shitless, comes 
charging around the corner, gun drawn, and the desperate man

Melman and speaks in clipped "Yessirs" and "Nossirs."
Behind them is an EMPTY SARCOPHAGUS. Sapir rubs his eyes.
SAPIR

Starting to ripple, and stretch...
Without warning a single, flattened BULLET is pushed upward 
through the skin, and EJECTED like an unwanted virus. Then 
the other bullets. P-toink! P-toink! ALL ejected. And more

shaped breasts is alone outside a deserted house...
SORORITY GIRL WITH IMMENSE, ODDLY-SHAPED 
BREASTS
Rick...? Kevin...? Come on you 
guys, this isn't funny anymore...
She grabs the door to the basement, takes a deep breath... 
and flings it open, AND —
A BIG CAT flies through the air screeching, because in these 
films cats never just come out quietly purring, oh, no, they 
have to be fucking rockets and make elephant sounds, and yes, 
dammit, it does piss me off because it is cheap, my friends.
The girl picks up the cat, breathing a big SIGH OF RELIEF...
Until A HAND GRABS HER and she spins around, SCREAMING —
But it's only the JANITOR, who nods apologetically, nothing 
to worry about, except then there is ANOTHER blast of SOUND, 
and she spins around AND —
This time it's only TIM, the harmless shepherd, milking a

They're both sitting in the back, while in front is EUGENE, 
wearing an adorable pair of Pooh Bear pajamas.
The kind with the feet. In his lap sits PETE THE DOG.
We'll never know why Eugene joined a monster club; hd's damn 
near crapping himself at this movie, he tries to hide behind 
Pete, who shoves his butt squarely in Eugene's face.
FAT KID
I can't see!
PATRICK
Eugene, make him sit down.
Eugene pushes on Pete's buttocks. Pete looks around lamely, 
much as you would if a little kid were pushing you on your 
buttocks.
FAT KID

An identical walkie-talkie is broadcasting the film to young 
SEAN CRENSHAW, who is perched on the roof of his house, and 
from here he can see the drive-in screen.
Pretty neat, huh?
Sean takes a sip of Coke and looks away from the movie for a 
moment... THE TOWN spreads out below him, a blanket of light. 
The distant BARK of a dog. The wind picks up, ruffles his 
hair.
ON THE HORIZON, dark, looming clouds roll in.
Lightning flickers inside them.
There is definitely, as they say, something in the air.
BEHIND SEAN the window to the house creaks OPEN... and he 
SPINS around, startled —
But it's only his father. He looks tired, haggard... Climbs 
out onto the roof holding a paper bag. He sits down next to 
Sean, takes burgers and fries from the bag.
DEL
What'd I miss?
Sean looks at his father, who lights a cigarette and looks, 
for one moment, incredibly old... And then Del smiles... and 
everything’s fine.
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY... as they perch together on the 
roof, father and son... watching the movie, side by side... 
and it's moments like this that make all the hard parts worth

EXT. BAYOU - NIGHT

THUNDER. Wind. A LANTERN glows on the porch of a weather-

listening to the blues on an old phonograph. He looks out 
across the vast swamp...
EXT. THE SWAMP

THE WOLFMAN prowls through the dank wilderness.
SNAKES coil around tree trunks. Creepers. Spanish moss.
BUZZ of insects. We’re talking MAJOR atmosphere.
The werewolf STOPS and sniffs. Apprehension. He GROWLS low 
and threatening, then WHIRLS TO SEE —
COUNT DRACULA standing before him, eyes glowing, one hand 
pointing to hold the beast in obeyance. In his other hand, he 
wields a cane with a gold wolf's head at its tip.
The count cocks his head, moves on... and the wolfman 
obediently falls into step behind him... moving toward the 
swamp...
39.
Finally, the count kneels at the lagoon's edge. And guess 
what? Something's DOWN THERE. First, we see dead fish float 
to the surface, and then... as Dracula watches, eyes 
ablaze...
A GREEN TALONED HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE. Scares us silly, 
while on the soundtrack we HEAR a familiar rift of horns: the 
theme for THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON.
The creature submerges once again. A pause. Then, it RISES 
LIKE A KRAKEN out of the pond, hoisting something — DROPS IT 
at the count's feet... It is a crate. THE Crate.
This time we have no trouble reading the work: FRANKENSTEIN.
The creature's gills vibrate in and out, as Dracula bends low 
over the crate, begins to STROKE it, as you would a favorite 
pet.
DRACULA
It's been so long... So very 
long...
THE GILL-MAN watches. As an insect goes by, his TONGUE leaps 
out a good two feet to snag it, while: Dracula takes his 
cane, holding it over the crate, pushes a button, and — KA-
SPAK! —
The cane SHOOTS OPEN to a length of four feet. See, it's no 
longer a cane at all, what it is, IS — it's a LIGHTNING ROD. 
He holds the rod high in the air, looks to the sky.
DRACULA
Wake up, old friend...
And JAMS THE ROD THROUGH the top of the crate. He steps back 
--
DRACULA
It is... our time.
And sure enough — a CRACK OF LIGHTNING flashes down to strike 
the lightning rod, and BZZZTTTT!! A spider-web of VOLTAGE 
dances in sparkling networks around the crate, until — POW!!
A shattering EXPLOSION as the crate's wooden sides fall away, 
charred and smoking. The gill-man BACKS OFF with fear, fish-
eyes dilating. The wolfman GROWLS...
And then, as the ECHO OF THUNDER dies slowly away... the 
electricity dies, the wind dies down, and all becomes 
still...
40.
A HAND THRUSTS UPWARD — stitches where it1s been SEWN onto 
the dead wrist. Reaching out at long last, and then a voice 
from the grave chokes out the words:
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Long time... Master...
The Prince of Darkness GRINS with sadistic glee. The Creature 
applauds. The Wolfman HOWLS... The moon rides high.
The Frankenstein Monster has awakened.

your bed, like this.
PHOEBE
Your mom did this when you were a 
little girl?
EMILY
Uh-huy. And it means that I love 
you, and as long as it's here 
nothing bad can happen.
PHOEBE
Sean says when it lightnings, 
monsters come.
EMILY
He was just trying to scare you, 
honey.
PHOEBE
Will lightning hit the house?
EMILY
No.
PHOEBE
The candle keeps it away?
EMILY
That1s right.
(kisses Phoebe)
PHOEBE
41.
Say goodnight to Mr. Scrap.
EMILY
Goodnight, Mr. Scrap. Goodnight, 
sweetheart.
She starts to leave.
PHOEBE
Are you gonna yell at him?
Emily stops. Frowns.
EMILY
Honey, I love your father —
PHOEBE
What?
(a pause)
I meant Sean. For scaring me.
EMILY
(recovering)
Oh. Of course you did. I'll talk to 
him.
INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
44
44
Sean sits at the kitchen table, leafing through the Van 
Helsing diary. We hear ANGRY VOICES from off-screen.
DEL (O.S.)
Fine. I'm a lousy father.
EMILY (O.S.)
I didn't say that.
DEL (O.S.)
Forgive me. The counselor said it. 
You listened.
Sean rises to see what's going on. He peers through the 
shutters on the kitchen-door, SEES his parents arguing in the 
living room. Candle-flame flickers across their faces.
EMILY
Why don't you be there next time.
DEL
Sure, hey, I'll quit my job. We can 
spend more time together mortgaging 
the house, waiting in bread 
lines...
42.
(he trails off)
Sean closes the shutters, depressed... Then he notices the 
family phone-message board, where he SEES:
FOR: Sean CALLER: Mr. Alucard (school) ?
MESSAGE: Interested in Van Halen diary. Possible $$$
Sean looks at the message curiously. He returns to the table, 
absently takes a pencil and paper, begins scribbling...
EMILY (O.S.)
You don't even care. You're 
thinking about your job, aren't 
you? I can see it in your eyes —
DEL (O.S.)
Oh, well, I'm glad you can see it 
in my eyes,, for a minute I thought 
I had you fooled —
EMILY (O.S.)
Please don't...
Sean continues scribbling, trying to ignore his parents, 
absently putting the letters ALUCARD in reverse order: DR...
DEL (O.S.)
—No, really, come look in my eyes, 
I'll think about stuff and you can 
tell me when I'm thinking 
correctly. Well, I had a lousy 
night,all right?
EMILY (O.S.)
Please...
...A C...
DEL (O.S.)
Do you care? Some guy steals a 
priceless Egyptian mummy — ? Well, 
that happens every day, skip that — 
and I get a call, some guy's 
shouting he's a werewolf! Huh? You 
like that? So they blow him away, 
and next thing the body's gone and 
an ambulance driver is found torn 
to shreds. Nice night, huh? Not as 
important as your marriage 
counselor, maybe —
43.
...U L A. D-R-A-C-U-L-A... Holy shit. Sean stares at the word 
he's written, then up, hearing his father's words, hearing 
his parents' marriage crumble...
EMILY (O.S.)
I — really don't care to listen 
anymore.
But as horrible as that is... there are things more horrible.
DEL (O.S.)
Fine. I knew that. Saw it in your 
eyes... Tell you what, next time we 
argue let's get some dark glasses, 
what do you say?
Because Del Crenshaw is a cop; he's been trained not to 
believe in monsters —but Sean, he's ten, and right about now, 
his eyes are as wide as saucers... A CRACK of THUNDER!
INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - SAME
45
45
Everything silent, serene, as our pal EUGENE (in adorable 
P.J.s) tries to sleep, but lest we forget, he has recently 
seen the bone-chilling GROUNDHOG DAY, PART 12, so sleep? 
Forget about it.
Presently, from across the room, we become aware of SOUNDS: 
Shuffle. Shuffle... THUMP. Eugene's eyes pop wide open.
INT. A BEDROOM DOOR
46
46
as Eugene's tiny hand reaches into frame and knocks. The door 
OPENS... and there's Eugene's recently-asleep Dad. I think we 
can safely say he's not pleased.
EUGENE
There's a monster in my closet.
INT. HALLWAY - EUGENE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
47
47
EUGENE, DAD, and PETE THE DOG trudge down the hallway.
Dad is annoyed, the others terrified beyond words.
EUGENE'S DAD
I told the boy not to read the damn 
monster books. Didn't I tell you? 
Like to throw them books out, that' 
s what I' d like to do...
44.
70 He opens the door to Eugene's room. Flicks on the light.
Silent. Empty. No monsters here.
EUGENE'S DAD
Damn, son, look at all those 
monsters.
(speaks to air)
Hey, you, get off the bed.
(beat)
You see any monsters?
Eugene points at the closet.
EUGENE'S DAD
The closet, huh?
(sighs)
Fine, we'll take a look in the 
closet, we'll do that.
He crosses to the closet door. Eugene squeezes his eyes shut. 
Pete the Dog boogies, leaves the room entirely. Dad, of 
course, is merely annoyed.
EUGENE'S DAD
Come on, monsters.
He flings open the door, and there's the MUMMY, and Jesus, 
he's the scariest thing we could ever possibly imagine 
finding in a closet, except, see — Eugene's Dad ISN'T EVEN 
LOOKING. He's busy talking to Eugene, who ALSO isn't looking, 
his eyes shut tight.
EUGENE'S DAD
Ooooh, Look at that big, scary 
monster.
And meanwhile the Mummy's dried-up lips curl over skeleton 
teeth in a horrifying LEER —and Eugene's Dad slams the door 
in his 2000 year-old face.
EUGENE'S DAD
You're NOT sleeping with your 
mother and me, and this keeps up 
you're not gonna SEE those monster 
books, understand?
He exits, followed by Eugene. Pete the Dog cowers in the 
hallway. Eugene starts to follow his Dad... but he can't 
resist: he HAS to take one last look, and so, fearfully, he 
turns —
And sees an ancient gauze bandage trail out the window.
45.
Eugene's eyes are bigger than his entire head.
EXT. EUGENE'S HOUSE - ON A TRASH CAN
48
48
And in go the monster books. SLAM!
BACK INSIDE - CLOSE ON EUGENE
His eyes squeezed shut. WE HEAR soft TAPPING sounds from 
offscreen... THE WINDOW.
Obviously, the last thing in the history of earth Eugene 
wants to do is look. So naturally, slowly, with terrified 
apprehension, he OPENS HIS EYES... and SEES: AT THE WINDOW - 
SEAN
gesturing wildly. Then PATRICK pops into view! Then FAT KID!
INT. MONSTER CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT
49
49
The words "MONSTER SQUAD" are written on a blackboard.
WE PULL OUT to reveal the entire Monster Club ASSEMBLED, lit 
by a single overhead bulb. Rudy swigs a beer, smokes a 
cigarette.
RUDY
Okay, we're all here, what's the 
deal?
FAT KID
Yeah, what's Monster Squad, anyway?
SEAN
It's us.
(beat)
WE're the Monster Squad.
PATRICK
Since when?
SEAN
Since now.
FAT KID
What's a squad?
PATRICK
It's like Miami Vice, I think.
Sean takes a deep breath.
46.
SEAN
Look. I think there's monsters, you 
guys... Like real ones.
EUGENE
(pathetically)
Mummy came in my house.
This is universally ignored.
SEAN
Tonight I heard my Dad talking and 
there was a guy at the police 
station who said he was a werewolf 
and they shot him.
PATRICK
Whoa...
|' SEAN
The body disappeared from the 
ambulance... and the ambulance guy 
was dead.
FAT KID
So he got shot and a werewolf took 
his body?
SEAN
No, peenhead, he WAS a were­ wolf ! 
Maybe.
PATRICK
But if they shot him...
SEAN
It must have been regular bullets. 
Not silver ones.
RUDY
Does that mean I'm in the club, or 
what?
SEAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're in...
(beat)
Look, Guys. Dracula might be here, 
too...
EUGENE
(pathetically)
Mummy came in my house.
Pause.
47.
PATRICK
EEeeewi Man! Fat Kid farted!
FAT KID
Did not, it was Pete!
Rudy is extremely amused by every aspect of this meeting.
SEAN
(exploding)
Goddammit, SHUT UP!!
Everything stops. They all look at him.
SEAN
Didn't you guys hear what I said? 
The guys were dead! Get a clue, 
don't you understand? Something's 
out there, and it's killing people, 
and if it's monsters...nobody but 
us is gonna do anything about it!
Pause. Everyone averts their eyes.
PATRICK
(clears his throat)
So... What do we do?
Sean holds up Van Helsing's crumbling diary.
SEAN
I think this book is important. My 
mom says they found it in some old 
house on Shadowbrook Road, but I 
don’t know what it says. It's all 
in German.
PATRICK
My big sister takes German in high 
school.
FAT KID
Your sister doesn't speak German. 
All she does is hang around and let 
guys touch her hogans.
RUDY
(lighting a cigarette)
Your sister doesn't live next door, 
does she?
PATRICK
(absently)
Yeah, so...?
48.
SEAN
Oh, I almost forgot. There might be 
a mummy.
EUGENE
(pathetically)
Mummy came in my house.
The others all stare at him.
SEAN
So what do you say?
(sticks his hand out in 
front of him)
Are we Monster Squad, or what...?
CLOSE ON SEAN'S HAND
as PATRICK puts his hand on top, followed by FAT KID'S, 
RUDY'S, and EUGENE'S. After a beat, PETE THE DOG'S PAW JOINS 
them.
RUDY
How does that dog GET up here, 
anyway?...
EXT. SCARY MANSION - EDGE OF THE SWAMP - DEAD OF NIGHT
50
50
A house on the edge of reality: it was once a Southern 
Colonial, but, now it's a big, rotting hulk...windows like 
gaping eyes...no coincidence that it reminds us of CASTLE 
DRACULA....
SWAMP INSECTS BUZZ. Leaves blow and scatter. A sign swings 
loudly: 666 SHADOWBROOK ROAD.
INT. HALLWAY (SCARY HOUSE) - NIGHT
51
51
COUNT DRACULA glides down a creepy hallway, carrying a 
lantern. The light flickers on his evel features.
At the end of the corridor is a manniquin wearing a 
Confederate Civil War uniform, and wielding a rifle with 
bayonet. Dracula PUSHES the rifle barrel UPWARD, and —
THE WALL PROMPTLY OPENS — A secret panel. He enters.
INT. DUNGEON STAIRWELL
52
52
Under the house. A subterranean stone stairwell. Dust.
49.
Cobwebs. Rats. Glowing lantern light creates dancing shadows 
against the rock walls...as Dracula descends the stairs....
He appears at the bottom, moves to a small, dark stone cell.
DRACULA
Old friend. I hope you like your 
new home....
In the shadows of the cell sits THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER, 
chained to a wall...rocking back and forth...looking lost and 
pitiful.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Home....
DRACULA
I must sleep soon, so I listen 
carefully. Van Helsing's diary is 
missing.
(beat)
I wish you to retrieve it for me. 
Do you understand?
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Yes, Master....
DRACULA
Children possess it. I want you to 
find them, and take the diary. If 
they do not co-operate. ..you will 
kill them. Do you understand?
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Yes, Master....
DISSOLVE:
EXT. SCARY GERMAN GUY'S HOUSE - DAY
53
53
Sean, Patrick and Fat Kid do not look thrilled to be here.
FAT KID
Gentlemen. I'd just like to say 
three words, okay? Scary. German. 
Guy.
Sean holds up the diary.
SEAN
50.
Yeah, well, who ELSE are we gonna 
get to translate this thing? Now 
come on! Some­ body go up there and 
knock.
PATRICK
YOU knock, you're our leader.
A MAILMAN walks past and they make an elaborate show of doing 
other things: reading, looking at watches, whistling. It 
looks like a circus act. The mailman stares and shakes his 
head.
SEAN
Look. My dad's a cop, right? Even 
if the guy’s a total froot loop, 
what's he gonna do?
FAT KID
Sean. Firstly, he's scary, okay? 
And B — he's German. Maybe he 
doesn't even know English.
PATRICK
Okay, so what's German for, "Please 
don't murder us?"
A voice directly behind them says:
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Bitte, morden sie uns nicht.
They spin around, staring up in horror — at SCARY GERMAN GUY 
himself, holding a bag of groceries, and smiling with crooked 
yellow TEETH.
EXT. CRENSHAW BACK YARD - DAY
54
54
PHOEBE sits on the grass in the shade of the tree house.
She plucks a daisy, and tosses it into the creek.
PHOEBE
Target: fifty degrees, Mr. Scrap.
Mr. Scrap looks on, as Phoebe grabs a handful of pebbles and 
starts chucking them at the floor, trying to sink it.
As the daisy floats downstream, Phoebe picks up Mr. Scrap and 
adjusts him like it’s a military inspection.
PHOEBE
Excellent mission, Mr. Scrap.
51.
Then... a SHADOW falls over Phoebe and Mr. Scrap. Giant, Mud-
caked boots. Rectangular. Phoebe turns to SEE —
THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER towering over her.
Admit it. When you were a kid, you had this nightmare.
INT. SCARY GERMAN GUY'S HOUSE - DAY
55
55
A cozy, carpeted affair. Not creepy or scary in any way.
Much to the relief of Sean Patrick, and Fat Kid, who sit 
side-by-side on a couch, and not only do they NOT look 
scared, buy they're actually SMILING. Before them are pie, 
Cokes, napkins, and, of course:
SCARY GERMAN GUY, ,who isn't threatening in the least.
He is bent over the crumbling Van Helsing diary, squints 
through bifocals.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
"The amulet itself is fairly small, 
and carved with intricate 
symbols..."
He holds up the book to reveal a crude ink sketch of the 
AMULET we saw at the beginning of the movie.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Rather an odd-looking thing, don't 
you think?
FAT KID nods and downs the last of his cherry pie.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
More pie?
Fat Kid obviously wants more, but his friends are looking at 
him. He shakes his head.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Well, I can’t finish mine. Perhaps 
you could help me?
Fat Kid grins, takes the pie. He nudges Patrick beside him:
FAT KID
(sotto)
Scary German Guy’s bitchin’.
While Sean questions Scary German Guy, Patrick admires a 
model airplane mounted on the table beside him.
52.
SEAN
Sir, I don't quite understand the 
part about equil — equilibrium?
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Well, according to this rather 
curious book you've brought me, the 
forces of good and evil — that's a 
B-17, in case you're wondering —
(Patrick smiles)
— Good and evil are in constant... 
flux. Back and forth. Only once, 
every hundred years are the forces 
balanced.
SEAN
So what about the amulet?
SCARY GERMAN GUY
The amulet, as nearly as I can 
translate, is concentrated...good. 
It is a talisman which wards off 
evil, and is — how do you say — 
indestructible?
FAT KID
That means it can't be destroyed.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(smiles)
Or in any case, NORMALLY destroyed. 
However — and this part is under­ 
lined — "Once, every hundred years,
SCARY GERMAN GUY
at the stroke of midnight, the 
amulet becomes vulnerable. In THAT 
moment... it can be shattered..."
Silence. The boys are on pins and needles.
SEAN
And? If it is?
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Then the balance between good and 
evil will shift... and EVIL will 
rule...
The Squad exchange "Holy Shit" glances.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
There is a German expression for 
such a cataclysm. Gotterdamarung.
53.
• FAT KID
If I said that, my Mom would wash 
my mouth out with soap.
PATRICK
(to Sean)
What’s this got to do with 
werewolves?
SEAN
(ignoring him)
Sir if... if something evil, 
like... well, like monsters, could 
get ahold of the amulet, and 
destroy it, then... then they could 
rule the world, right?
Scary German Guy looks at him with confusion. Or is it 
concern?
FAT KID
Sounds like a knock-knock joke.
Everyone looks at Fat Kid.
FAT KID
You know, like: knock-knock. Who’s 
there? Gotterdamurung. 
Gotterdamurung who?
Everyone CONTINUES to look at him, awaiting the answer.
FAT KID
(clears his throat)
Then there'd be... some... play on 
words, or something...
Scary German Guy saves the day by chiming in with:
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Uh, the book continues. Our friend 
Mr. Van Helsing claims there IS a 
way to stop the forces of darkness.
SEAN
HOW? ’
SCARY GERMAN GUY
If one could gain possession of the 
amulet BEFORE the forces of 
darkness ...then every hundred 
years, at mid­ night, there is 
another option...
(squinting at book)
54.
...A ceremony, which, when followed 
to the letter... will open a hole 
into limbo itself, where dwell the 
damned. A vortex, which like a 
great whirlpool... can swallow the 
forces of evil... forever...
PAUSE. A moment of humility.
SEAN
Does it, um, describe the procedure 
at all?
SCARY GERMAN GUY
In detail. This is the last entry. 
On this date, he was to battle 
those forces himself.
He frowns with interest, points to the top of the page.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
...Interesting. It is TOMORROW’S 
date. A hundred years ago...
Sean GRABS the diary. Looks at the data-entry himself.
SEAN
A hundred years ago... TOMORROW 
night...
The Monster Squad look at each other.
EXT. SCARY GERMAN GUY'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
56
56
The boys come out. Scary German Guy stands in the open 
doorway.
THE SQUAD
God, thanks. Thanks a lot. Etc.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
I expect you boys thought I was 
some kind of monster myself, hmmm? 
A vampire, perhaps?
The boys look at each other, guiltily.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(grinning)
It's quite all right, but I'm NOT, 
you know. If I were a vam­ pire —
(points to a mirror 
mounted on the door)­
55.
— then I wouldn't have a re­ 
flection, now would I?
FAT KID
Man, you sure know a lot about 
monsters.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(a beat)
Now you mention it, I suppose I 
do.. .
CLOSE ANGLE - SCARY GERMAN GUY'S HAND
As he closes the door, WE SEE a faint blue NUMBER tattooed 
into the skin of his wrist...
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY
57
57
Sean, Patrick and Fat Kid walk along the railroad tracks.
Fat Kid has found a big ol' walking stick.
PATRICK
Tomorrow night?! Gimme a major 
break — what do we have to do 
again? Blow a hole in Dumbo?
SEAN
Limbo, stupid.
PATRICK
Well, how do we know the amulet's 
here, anyway?
SEAN
Because, dweeb, Dracula's obviously 
here looking for it, and if WE 
don't find it before him, we're 
beast-bait.
PATRICK
(pause)
Okay, so say we get the amulet. 
Then what? Wait 'til midnight, and 
—
SEAN
We get — a virgin.
PATRICK
A virgin. Right. Okay. Then what?
56.
SEAN
Then — the virgin takes the amulet, 
reads the ancient spell or 
whatever, and BAM! We blow a hold 
in limbo.
PATRICK
(shrugs)
No biggie.
SEAN
Cinch.
FAT KID
Piece of cake.
They nod confidently, walks on.
SEAN
'Course, you KNOW what a virgin is.
Pause. Nobody meets anyone else's gaze.
PATRICK
Huh? Yeah, I know. Of course. Don't 
you?
SEAN
Of course I know. YOU know, don't 
you, Fat Kid?
FAT KID
Me? Sure, I know. Who doesn't?
Pause. Still, no eyes meet. They stop. Look at each other.
EXT. 50'S BURGER DRIVE-IN - DAY
58
58
The guys approach RUDY, who is munching a burger, swigging a 
container of mile. They sit across from him, determined.
SEAN
Rudy? Question.
RUDY
Shoot.
(he takes a swig of milk 
—)
SEAN
What's a virgin?
57.
— and proceeds to do one of the most hilarious spit-takes in 
the history of motion pictures. Milk sprays out his nose.
EXT. CRENSHAW BACK YARD - DAY
59
59
The gang crosses to the clubhouse, as PHOEBE comes running up 
and grabs Sean's arm, gibbering like a pig-tailed lunatic:
PHOEBE
Sean. Hurry. Omigod. Gotta see. 
Come on.
SEAN
(distracted)
Phoebe, you're being a spaz — okay 
— Rudy, we're gonna need silver 
bullets --
PHOEBE
Sean, puleeezze. Come on. LOOK.
Sean puts a hand over her mouth. She makes grunting noises.
SEAN
Phoebe, handle life, okay?... Fat 
Kid, get a map and find Shadowbrook 
Road. If the diary was there, maybe 
the amulet is too.
Phoebe bites his hand.
SEAN
Owl! You BRAT — ! I'm telling Mom--
PHOEBE
Would you look??
Everyone looks --
As the FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER steps out from behind the tree. 
For a moment, time seems to stand still.
Okay. Here's the effect we’re going for: the kids do not RUN 
away. We do not SEE them move. Rather, they simply APPEAR on 
the other side of the lawn. As far away as possible and still 
have the same zip code.
PHOEBE takes the monster by one huge, crudely attached hand.
PHOEBE
It’s okay, you guys, he’s friends 
with us 1
58.
The kids, all huddled in their hiding places, shake their 
heads. They won’t budge. Would you?
PHOEBE
Come on, don’t be chicken!
A pause... then...SEAN detaches from the group.
RUDY
Whoa. Go for it.
PATRICK
Sean, are you CRAZY?? That’s a 
walking dead guy!
FAT KID
Sean, please don’t die!
Sean continues across the grass...as PHOEBE leads the monster 
slowly toward him... The others cower in AWE, watching...
And there, in his own back yard, on a magical spring 
twilight... Sean Crenshaw comes face to face with a 
monster...a real one. He reaches out his hand. The Monster 
does likewise.
And their hands MEET. Sean just STARES into the monster’s 
eyes.
SEAN
Are you... are you dead...?
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
...DEAD ...
And suddenly, Sean gasps, because, see, the monster is 
squeezing much too hard, he’s going to CRUSH Sean's hand so 
Sean, not yet panicking, says —
SEAN
Too hard!
And guess what. The monster lets go. Just like that.
On his face is a look of indescribable SORROW. Sean turns to 
Phoebe.
SEAN
Does Mom know about him?
PHOEBE
Uh-uh. Just us.
She grins. Sean grins. Then WHOOPS WITH JOY —
59.
SEAN
GET OVER HERE, YOU GUYS!
Claps the monster on the back. The monster grins and claps 
Sean on the back...which knocks him flying out of frame.
PHOEBE
NOW can I be in the monster club?
INT. MONSTER CLUBHOUSE - DAY
60
60
Everyone is here, including the monster himself. The kids are 
gathered around, staring. Sean runs a hand through his hair.
SEAN
I don't believe this... 
Frankenstein's monster is in our 
clubhouse!
PATRICK
(nervous)
Let's ask him to leave, okay?
SEAN
You aren't still scared, are you?
The monster plays with Mr. Scrap, oblivious. He looks, up, 
bobbing his head and grinning like an idiot. Goes back to 
playing.
FAT KID
He is a little bit gross, Sean.
Frankenstein SPEAKS then. His voice is hesitant and awful-
sounding, but once he gets started he’s like one of those 
parrots that won’t shut up.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Mister... Scrap...
PHOEBE
(beaming)
I taught him to talk.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
BOGUS... GIMMEE A BREAK...
SEAN
Terrific.
PATRICK
Huddle.
60.
The kids gather and converse in hushed tones. In the b.g., 
the monster marches Mr. Scrap across the floor. We're not 
exactly sure where the fun is in this, but he seems happy and 
he’s not breaking anything.
PATRICK
Sean, we gotta tell somebody. Your 
Dad's a cop, maybe —
SEAN
No way. No grownups. They’ll kill 
him or lock him up or...dissect him 
or something. He’s not hurting any­ 
one.
Rudy grins and holds up a box.
RUDY
Dudes! Check it out.
What it is, it's the COLLEGEVILLE HALLOWEEN COSTUME: cheap 
plastic mask, flimsy costume clothing. The only people 
frightened by this costume are the marketing people, trying 
to foist it past the Better Business Bureau. NEVERTHELESS
As Rudy shows the Frankenstein mask to the monster... even 
though it's just cheap plastic ' —
The monster RECOILS IN FEAR...cowers, clutching Mr. Scrap, as 
a tear slides down his cheek — and he utters a single word 
which speaks volumes:
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
...scary...
The kids look at each other.
INT. A GIRL’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
61
61
Remember the girl we saw earlier? The teen angel coming out 
of the swimming pool? You don't? Well, trust me, she's 
gorgeous.
Pink robe. Soft slippers. As we watch...she stands, pinning 
back her hair, crosses to the open window and SHUTS IT:
EXT. PATRICK'S BACK YARD - AFTERNOON
62
62
As the window shuts, WE REVEAL: the monster clubbers, 
crouched, hidden in the bushes. The Frankenstein monster is 
with them.
61.
SEAN
This is a bad idea.
PATRICK
Rudy, she's my sister...
RUDY
She's also a major babe, so lighten 
up.
(to FAT KID)
You got the camera?
SEAN
Rudy. Listen to me. I'm gonna say 
this once.
(everyone stops, listens)
Tomorrow at midnight, evil may rule 
the world.
RUDY
That's it? That's what you had to 
say?
SEAN
Yeah.
RUDY
Fine. We'll save the world later.
(beat)
Trust me. I'm in Junior High.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Six figures detach themselves from the bushes...the kids and 
the monster creeping across the backyard... carefully 
skirting the edge of the swimming pool...
Except, truth be known, the monster simply isn't that swift. 
He plunges out of sight — a loud SPLASH, followed by 
thrashing sounds and cries of:
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
BOGUS, BOGUS.
BACK IN THE BUSHES - MOMENTS LATER
The kids are gathered around the monster with disgusted looks 
on their faces. He is DRENCHED to the bone. Sits like a 
kicked puppy.
RUDY
(annoyed)
Okay, we're gonna try it again, and 
this time we do it right.
62.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Bogus...
RUDY
Shut up, Frank.
EXT. PATRICK’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
63
63
The kids crouch beneath a lighted window; about six feet off 
the ground, a bathroom window... Frankenstein Monster stands 
against the wall, as the kids whisper.
PATRICK
She’ll be out any minute now.
RUDY
Good. Okay. So Frank stands here at 
the window. She gets out of the 
shower, sees him, has a cow. She 
runs —
(he points)
— into the hall, passing window 
B...
FAT KID
And I take her picture.
SEAN
This is a bad idea.
PATRICK
Sshhh! Water stopped.
RUDY
This is it.
FAT KID
Oh boy!...
And suddenly, from offscreen, comes a VOICE:
VOICE (O.S.)
Patrick...?
PATRICK
Cheese it! My Dad!
RUDY
Move.
He grabs the monster's arm, starts to run, comes to the end 
of Frank's arm, and have you ever tried pulling a telephone 
pole out of the sidewalk? The monster won't budge.
63.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hello..?
Rudy takes a running start, tries again, and practically 
flies in the air at the end of Frank’s arm, and mean­ while —
The monster stares through the window at Patrick's naked 
sister... His face twists into a lecherous GRIN, as...
The combined might of five kids drags him away from the 
window, kicking... As an afterthought, a desperate FAT KID 
leaps into the air holding the camera over his head... snaps 
the FLASH at window level. Runs away.
EXT. ROAD - TWILIGHT
64
64
The Monster Squad and the Monster head off, silhouetted 
against the setting sun... Six friends, and one of them is 
REALLY tall.
PATRICK
I got it. Here's how we stop 
Wolfman: have Frankenstein fight 
him!
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
GIMMEE A BREAK...
DISSOLVE:
EXT. SCARY HOUSE - DUSK
65
65
The house on Shadowbrook Road broods beneath a full moon, 
which defies the lunar calendar specifically so it can be 
full throughout our movie. Thanks, moon.
INT. HALLWAY - THE HOUSE - NIGHT
66
66
CAMERA GLIDING down the corridor. WE BOOM DOWN — THROUGH the 
floorboards, where rats skitter and squeak, DOWN THROUGH 
STONE, EMERGING —
INT. CREEPY DUNGEON CORRIDOR
67
67
Shadows dance and flicker, as DRACULA prowls along the eerie 
stone corridor, a bobbing lantern in one hand, a steel 
SLEDGEHAMMER in the other...
64.
The WOLFMAN creeps at his side, watching, while Dracula TAPS 
the walls with the hammer... probing... looking for 
something...
DRACULA
The amulet is here. I feel it.
Tap tap tap.
DRACULA
Where, Van Helsing? Where have you 
hidden it...?
Tap tap tap. Pause. Dracula notices something in the corner 
of the dungeon. Moves the lantern to SEE:
A SATCHEL lies on the ground, loaded with STICKS OF 
DYNAMITE... A skeleton-hand grips the satchel.
Dracula holds the lantern up REVEALING:
The SKELETON of a long dead explorer. Its other hand is 
outstretched, pointing at the wall behind Dracula.
The vampire turns. Taps the wall.
A different sound. More hollow. Tap tap tap.
Dracula smiles, hands the lantern to Wolfman, steps back, 
grips the sledge —
And proceeds to HAMMER the shit out of the stone wall.
CRACK—! Stone flies — CRACK—1 Erupting in bursts -- CRACK—! 
As he SMASHES the sledge into solid rock, FRENZIED, 
possessed, the CUTS quicker and quicker, Crack-SLAM—! Crack-
SLAM—! UNTIL —
A BLINDING LIGHT BLASTS OUT of a tiny hole in the wall.
All that pounding, by an inhuman monster with the strength of 
ten, and THIS is all the headway he could make... But it's 
enough.
Enough for him to put his eye up to, and LOOK IN...
INT. SECRET VAULT - START ON DRACULA'S EYE
68
68
looking in, an unearthly GLOW illuminating the stone wall... 
then PULL BACK TO REVEAL...
65.
CRUCIFIXES, a sea of them, plastered over every inch of 
wallspace... and GARLIC, too, clove after rotting clove, 
enough to feed a small and not very discriminating nation...
An then of course, there is the MAIN ATTRACTION, because, 
boys and girls, the count has struck pay-dirt. Because, you 
guessed it...
100 years later, thousands of miles farther away... but every 
bit as powerful — the AMULET dances with magical SPARKS of 
color...
BACK OUTSIDE THE VAULT - DRACULA
as he smiles, looks at the Wolfman. Takes a step back.
Grips the steel SLEDGE. Pause. And then — just as he is about 
to SWING for all he's worth — he cocks his head, looks 
eastward, and —
EXT. BAYOU - DAWN
69
69
Over the swamps, a deep purple sky beckons the rising sun.
BACK TO DRACULA
Sudden sweat.
DRACULA
Damn!
But triumph returns to his expression, as he drops the 
sledge,, and touches the stone wall...
DRACULA
Tomorrow night... Our reunion must 
wait until then, my prize...
Wolfman looks on, uncomprehendingly.
DRACULA
Soon, Van Helsing... Soon, the 
creatures of the night shall rule 
the world...
(pause)
And there's NO ONE TO STOP US...
And from nowhere, a fiendish LAUGH; a laugh so evil, so 
demonic, it gives you chills, and as his eyes GLOW RED HOT —
THE TOP 40 HIT "MONSTER SQUAD THEME" KICKS IN, and we begin 
the following MUSICAL MONTAGE:
66.
INT. SEAN'S ROOM
70
70
A MORNING ALARM CLOCK RINGS and SEAN CRENSHAW sits bolt 
upright in bed.
AS (97) FAT KID, (98) PATRICK, (99) RUDY come BURSTING THRU 
OUT OF THEIR HOUSES, ON THE MOVE, AND 99
EXT. INTERSECTION
71
71
Four speeding BICYCLES come hurtling toward the camera: SEAN; 
PATRICK; FAT KID; RUDY.
INT. TREEHOUSE
72
72
PHOEBE and the monster. Phoebe hangs seashell EARRINGS on his 
ears. Frank makes A HORRIFIED face, while Phoebe giggles and 
kicks.
INT. CLASSROOM
73
73
The three elementary schoolers fidget, watching the clock, 
while Meow Mix drones oh, and on... and on...
INT. JUNIOR HIGH SHOP
74
74
Rudy works on a lathe, carving lengths of wood into razor­ 
keen STAKES. The SHOP TEACHER grins at him, nods like a 
buffoon.
INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN
75
75
EMILY CRENSHAW slides open a drawer, only to discover that 
her silverware is strangely missing —
INT. SHOP
76
76
— as RUDY looks both ways, whistles, drops Emily's entire 
collection into the SMELTER. The SHOP TEACHER grins at him, 
nods like a buffoon.
106 OMIT
INT. EUGENE'S ROOM
77
77
67.
EUGENE is seated at a tiny desk in his bedroom. He's got a 
pencil and paper, writing a LETTER... hilarious, five year-
old scrawl:
DEAR ARMY GUYS:
COME QUIK THERE ARE MONSTERS
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
78
78
The three Squadsters are in the lead as the doors BURST OPEN 
and kids come swarming out.
EXT. JUNIOR HIGH FIELD
79
79
Junior high kids in hilarious gym shorts practice archery, 
managing to pierce every available target except the painted 
one, as — RUDY strolls by, casually swipes a bow and arrows.
INT. EUGENE'S ROOM
80
80
Eugene's letter is taking on epic proportions. In addition to 
the text, he's done CRAYON SKETCHES of the monsters. (Next to 
Frankenstein's head is the word 'NICE').
Eugene's tongue peeks through his teeth as he Colors.
EXT. ANOTHER STREET
81
81
RUDY hands a box to SEAN, carefully shielding it from any 
bystanders. Real cloak-and-dagger spy-stuff.
INT. PATRICK'S ROOM
82
82
Patrick at his Apple Macintosh (TM) computer, creating a 
"MacArt" BUSINESS CARD design, and —
INT. MALL PRINT SHOP
83
83
He pulls a sheet from a Xerox machine, holds it up for a 
closer look: THE MONSTER SQUAD. Now it's official.
INT. GARAGE
84
84
RUDY slings the bow and arrows across his shoulder... grabs 
the vicious wood-stakes ... lights a cigarette. Move over, 
Stallone.
68.
EXT. CITY STREET
85
85
EUGENE stuffs his completed letter — addressed: UNITED STATES 
ARMY - HURRY! — into the corner mailbox.
INT. CRENSHAW BEDROOM
86
86
SEAN enters his father's bedroom, crosses to the gunbelt 
which hangs from the bedpost. He removes the gun from its 
holster, empties the bullets onto the bed.
Takes the BOX which Rudy gave him earlier — and with a pair 
of pliers, pulls the shells loose, inserts them into freshly 
forged silver bullet-casings.
On his face, a look of grim determination. He reloads the new 
silver bullets... silently replaces the gun in its holster.
INT. CLUBHOUSE
87
87
Squad assembled. SEAN runs his finger along a map, pauses 
next to SHADOWBROOK ROAD. Patrick, Rudy and Fat Kid LOOK ON.
PHOEBE and EUGENE watch, delighted, as Frankenstein's monster 
(wearing Rudy's Ray-bans) feeds Pete the Dog.
The expression on their faces is RADIANT, as our MONTAGE 
ENDS...
EXT. SCARY HOUSE - DUSK
88
88
The sun is a ghost in the west... the house sits silent at 
the edge of the rotting wilderness.
INT. PARLOR - SCARY HOUSE - NIGHT
89
89
THE DESPERATE MAN (a.k.a. Wolfman) sits heavily sedated in a 
broken armchair. Glassy-eyed. Expressionless. And no wonder; 
an open bottle of DEMEROL sits on the table beside him.
DRACULA
(entering)
I do regret the dosage, my friend. 
Most lethal by human standards, 
but... human standards don't 
apply... Do they?
He moves to the window, opens the curtains.
DRACULA
69.
Frankenstein's creation has failed 
me... But soon, the moon will be 
full, my friend... and tonight is 
too important for our plans to be 
jeopardized...
He returns to desperate man's chair.
DRACULA
I require sustenence... I trust you 
stocked the pantry as I 
requested...?
(the desperate man nods)
Good.
He SHOVES the chair forward — with desperate man IN IT — so 
it is facing the open window.
DRACULA
Then I'll go have a bite, while... 
you change into something more 
comfortable...
He exits, closing the parlor doors. We HEAR them LOCK... then 
the sound of receding footsteps. A pause, then...
The desperate man sits bolt upright in his chair. Alert.
Sweating. He SPITS OUT three tiny capsules, enough Demerol to 
stop an elephant, except, see, he didn't swallow them.
INT. HALLWAY (SCARY HOUSE) - NIGHT
90
90
Dracula moves to a pantry door... OPENS IT, AND —
IN THE PANTRY
are several YOUNG GIRLS huddled together, STARING with huge 
eyes. Pasty-white faces. Lips blue with terror... unable to 
utter a single sound. One is reminded of Nazi war camp 
footage.
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
91
91
Del Crenshaw looks like shit. He is smoking and talking on 
the phone. Behind him a TRANSVESTITE lounges in the holding 
tank.
DEL
70.
— no, honey, I'm NOT being 
condescending, you'll know when I'm 
being condescending,-like NOW, for 
instance...
SAPIR passes the desk, dumps a report on it.
DEL
What the hell's this? Honey...? 
Hello?
He hangs up.. Curses.
SAPIR
Last night, near the ambulance 
crash? Eyewitness report. Get 
this... along black hearse. No 
plates. You wanna ask about the 
hood ornament?
DEL
What about the hood ornament?
SAPIR
Thought you’d never ask.
(dramatic)
A silver... skull. I consider this 
an exciting lead. I'm excited. Are 
you excited?
DEL
Thrilled. Put out an A.P.B.
SAPIR
Already did. I'm a very good 
policeman, you know.
DEL
And everyone who believes in 
fairies clap their hands.
In the holding tank, the TRANSVESTITE grins, and THE ENTIRE 
SQUADROOM bursts into applause, as — Del's phone RINGS again.
DEL
(scooping it up)
Honey, I'm sorry, I —
PHONE VOICE
Crenshaw?!
DEL
Uh — yeah, this is Crenshaw —
71.
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
92
92
The DESPERATE MAN is huddled inside a telephone booth next to 
a deserted highway. Out of breath, frantic, because —
The FULL MOON is peeking through the clouds... and he1s 
starting to turn into a werewolf.
DESPERATE MAN
You’ve got to help me, the others 
wouldn't listen!
Hair, beginning to grow —
DESPERATE MAN
Get all of your men... Send them to 
666 Shadowbrook Road, it's an old 
mansion. He's found the amulet! 
There's no time!
Skin, stretching... hair, growing faster —
DEL
Who the hell is this?
DESPERATE MAN
I'm the one they shot last night! 
I'm a werewolf, but that's not 
important, PLEASE, just gather your 
men, and —
DEL
Have a nice night.
DESPERATE MAN
DON'T HANG UP!
Del sighs, disgusted, and does just that. But as he does — he 
hears an animal CROAK on the other end:
DESPERATE MAN (O.S.)
He's gonna kill your SON — !
Click. The connection is broken. But not before the words 
have registered, and a chill runs all the way up Del's 
spine...
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SAME
93
93
The desperate man stumbles from the phone booth, SCREAMING, 
clutching his face. His shirt BURSTS OPEN, and his face 
completes its lycanthropic transformation, AND —
72.
INI. THE CRENSHAW HOME - NIGHT
94
94
The moon filters through the open window. In the dark, EMILY 
CRENSHAW sits curled up in bed, looking at a television 
set... She looks incredibly forlorn.
TV NEWSCASTER
A school spokesman said the girls 
disappeared while on a wildlife 
field trip in the bayous...
We hear a distant wolf HOWL... Emily rises, shuts the window. 
A SHIVER runs through her. She returns to the bed... and, 
almost as an afterthought, takes the candle she gave Phoebe.
She lights it. Sets it gently beside her on the night-stand, 
curls up under the covers, and looks for all the world like a 
little lost girl afraid of the storm...
INT. DUNGEON CELLAR - ON SKELETON EXPLORER
95
95
We PAN DOWN TO his satchel, full of dynamite. A white, ringed 
hand reaches into frame, TAKES A stick of dynamite.
It is, of course, DRACULA... He grins.
EXT. A ROAD - THE BOONIES - NIGHT
96
96
BUZZ of insects. Fireflies in the air. WE CRANE DOWN TO 
REVEAL: FAT KID on a bike, munching a slice of pizza; EUGENE 
riding on the handlebars. SEAN rides a second bike.
They stop, turn around, and SEE the FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER 
lumbering along behind them, with PETE padding at his feet. 
Fat Kid gives Eugene a Twinkle. Sean speaks into a walkie-
talkie:
SEAN
Come in, Patrick.
INT. MONSTER CLUBHOUSE (INTERCUT)
97
97
PATRICK
I’m here. Where are you?
SEAN
Almost there. Everything set with 
you?
PATRICK
73.
Know in a minute. How we doing, 
Rudy?
In the alcove, Rudy sits by the window next to Phoebe.
He looks through his binoculars, gives Patrick a thumb1s up.
POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
Patrick's SISTER is in the driveway of her house, saying 
goodbye to a cheesy High School PREPPY in a white Trans Am. 
Backlit by moonlight, she is even more beautiful than the 
last time. Wait. Not possible.
Call it a draw.
RUDY
What hogans. A cheesy High School 
guy does not deserve those hogans.
PATRICK
Rudy's in love.
SEAN
Good for Rudy. Okay, remember: 
Rendezvous at position A, 2200 
hours.
PATRICK
Huh?
SEAN
Ten o'clock, dufus.
MEANWHILE, EUGENE HAS WANDERED AWAY FROM THE ROAD,
kneels by the swamp, eating his Twinkie. Pete paws at him to 
get some. Pete knocks it out of Eugene's hands... and it 
lands in the water.
EUGENE
Thanks, Pete.
He reaches for it...
AND THE CREATURE from the Black Lagoon RISES FROM THE WATER 
not two feet from his face. Pete does not run; he DISAPPEARS. 
You expect to see a cloud of dust in his shape left behind.
Eugene BOLTS UP. Backs away. The Creature submerges again.
PATRICK'S VOICE
(from the walkie-talkie )
How do we know the amulet's there?
74.
SEAN
We don't, but it's all we've got.
Eugene walks up from the swamp, arms dangling at his sides. 
Pete cowers at Frankenstein's feet.
PATRICK
(pause, then)
Sean... maybe... maybe we should 
call the cops...
SEAN
You think grown-ups would believe 
this? Get real, dude. It's us or 
nothing.
Eugene tugs on Sean's pants.
PATRICK
Yeah, yeah. Well... good luck, 
butthead.
Eugene tugs on Sean's pants.
SEAN
I know you are, but what am I? Over 
and out.
He lowers the walkie-talkie antennae. Eugene tugs on Sean's 
pants.
SEAN
WHAT, EUGENE?!?!
EUGENE
(pitifully)
Creature stole my Twinkle.
Sean and Fat Kid roll their eyes. They saddle up. As they 
ride off into the gloom, WE MOVE TO a sign: "SHADOW­ BROOK 
ROAD - 1/2 MILE"
INT. THE CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT
98
98
PATRICK'S SISTER sits awkwardly in a lawn chair, gazing with 
obvious distaste at the decor: too many monsters, and no 
balloon-o-grams or leg warmers.
PATRICK'S SISTER
(annoyed)
So...? What did you wanna ask me?
75.
PATRICK sits before her, as nervous as we've yet seen him. 
RUDY leans casually against the wall, drinking a beer...
PATRICK
(clears his throat)
Ask. Yes. Well.
(coughs)
That chair comfortable?
PATRICK'S SISTER
You've got one minute.
(Rudy takes a swig of 
beer)
I have to go home and take a 
shower.
(—and does the second 
most hilarious spit­ take 
in motion picture 
history)
PATRICK'S SISTER
WELL???
PATRICK
Um, what it is... I was just 
wondering if... urn... Rudy?
RUDY
Your show, ace.
PATRICK
Right.
(grins cheesily)
Well, sis, me and Rudy, we were 
kinda, urn, wondering... Are 
you...?
(coughs violently, 
blurts)
AREYOUAVIRGIN?
PATRICK'S SISTER
What? Stop coughing.
PATRICK
We just wanted to know... 
IFYOURAVIRGAN.
PATRICK'S SISTER
That's it. Goodbye.
RUDY
(clears his throat)
76.
Look, urn — what your brother is so 
delicately attempting to inquire, 
and, allow me to add my own 
personal curiosity... is, the 
degree to which you may have, or 
have not, at some point in time...
(beat)
...been dorked.
Patrick SLAPS his hand over his face.
EXT. CRENSHAW BACKYARD - NIGHT
99
99
PATRICK'S SISTER slings her purse over one shoulder and 
storms across the yard. Patrick trails behind her, desperate.
PATRICK'S SISTER
You guys are sick.
She runs smack into RUDY, who grins lecherously, a cigarette 
in place.
PATRICK'S SISTER
Out of my way, douchebag.
Rudy doesn't miss a beat. He calmly holds up a snapshot.
Patrick's sister looks at the photo... and her face turns 
twenty shades. She GRABS the picture and tears it to shreds.
Rudy just grins, holds up an envelope.
RUDY
The negative. Fotomat's got a two-
for-one deal this week, and 
wouldn't you know it — there's a 
spot on the bulletin board right 
between the prom committee notes 
and the football roster...
She swipes for the envelope, but Rudy holds it away.
Then the strangest thing happens. Not strange if you think 
about it, but strange to Rudy and Patrick.
Patrick's sister turns away and starts to CRY. Through her 
tears:
PATRICK'S SISTER
That's really shitty...
RUDY
Whoa, hey, chill out.
77.
PATRICK
We need your help! Okay? It's 
important! I woulda asked, but 
you'd say no —
PATRICK'S SISTER
How do YOU know?!... What about the 
night I was babysitting and Mom and 
Dad said you couldn't stay up for 
Creature Features, but I let you, 
anyway?!
Pause. Patrick looks at the ground.
PATRICK'S SISTER
(through tears)
You took advantage of me... you 
didn't ask me to help... You didn't 
even TRY...
She walks away. Rudy and Patrick look at one another 
guiltily.
RUDY
Hey —
Patrick's sister turns around... Rudy takes out his cigarette 
lighter, holds up the envelope, and LIGHTS IT.
He drops the burning negative to the ground.
LONG pause.
PATRICK'S SISTER
I suppose you think NOW I'll help 
you.
Rudy makes a face so endearingly helpless and sensitive, even 
WE don't know if he's bullshitting.
EXT. SCARY HOUSE - NIGHT
100
100
The boys crouch in the bushes next to the Frankenstein 
monster. Sean looks through a pair of binoculars, AT —
SEAN
Man...
The HOUSE. The ominous black Hearse is parked in front.
Aside from the BUZZ of mosquitoes, and the CALLS of swamp 
birds, everything is very quiet. Not to mention scary as 
hell.
78.
FAT KID
Sean, urn, about this Monster Squad 
thing. Maybe we could, like, re­ 
think it, you know what I mean?...
SEAN
Fat Kid, you're being a wuss.
(lowers the binocs, 
starts to move in)
Now come on, time's running out.
FAT KID
Sean. Ho.
(points)
Scary House. Real Monsters. Us. Ten 
Years Old. Remember?
SEAN
Midnight. End of world. Remember?
The MONSTER abruptly cocks his head... as if scenting 
something on the wind. He speaks:
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Master is near...
(looks straight at them)
Master wants you dead...
The boys didn't need to hear this. They exchange glances.
Sean moves forward...
FAT KID
Couldn't we be, like, Math Squad, 
instead? You know, do math 
problems, stay HOME...
(he follows unhappily)
Or NATURE Squad! We would look at 
rocks, collect birds... Not be 
dead. See, it's this whole death 
thing I'm not crazy about...
He passes a sign: "POSTED - STAY OUT - KEEP OUT”. Next to the 
words is a small skull-and-crossbones...
EXT. SCARY HOUSE - NIGHT
101

The group gathers at the bottom of the steps.
SEAN
I'll go first.
FAT KID
79.
I'm gonna pee.
SEAN
You go first.
INT. CREEPY DUNGEON
102
102
Enough dynamite to sink the Bismarck. WE MOVE ALONG a steel 
wire from the line of dynamite placed against the wall, TO...
DRACULA, who is hooking the line to an INDUSTRIAL 
DETONATOR...
INT. SCARY HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT
103
103
The huge front doors SLOWLY OPEN with an echo-y CREEAAKKK.
Fat Kid slowly ENTERS, followed by Sean, who shines a 
flashlight in front of them. Eugene, Pete and Frankenstein 
take up the rear.
FAT KID
Welp, no amulet. Let's go.
He turns to leave. Sean glares at him.
FAT KID
(pause)
The Brady Kids never did this shit.
FRANKENSTEIN
BRADY KIDS... MARSHA...
Sean glares at him. All around them are the peeling, ornate 
trappings of the by-gone Ante Bellum era. They move forward.
SEAN
Look. We got two consolations. One: 
Frankenstein's Monster's on our 
side. Second, my Dad's a cop, and 
if anyone messes with us, he'll 
kick their ass.
Sean turns, SEES the Monster still standing in the door­ way. 
He gestures and the Monster steps forward. The floorboards 
CREAK under his massive, heavy boots.
INT. DUNGEON CELLAR - ON DRACULA

as he HEARS the CREAK. He rises, tense, and we MOVE IN ON THE 
DETONATOR. The handle is loose. It slides... slowly... 
down...
Click.
KA-BOOM!!1
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - BACK UPSTAIRS
105
105
The doorframe COLLAPSES onto the Frankenstein monster as the 
EXPLOSION ROCKS THE HOUSE! The kids HIT THE DIRT. Sean looks 
up as the dust settles.
SEAN
FRANK!!
The kids DASH to the monster... who is BURIED under the 
debris.
Eugene grabs the huge hand, and pulls. Pete does the same 
with a piece of jacket in his teeth.
FAT KID
(helplessly; "What WAS 
that???")
Sean...?
SEAN
(looking around, scared)
I don’t know...
EUGENE
(still pulling)
Wake up, wake up...
Sean sadly SEES it is useless.
SEAN
Eugene —
EUGENE
He won't wakeup.
FAT KID
(emotional)
What do we do, Sean? The monster!
Sean rises angrily, equally emotional.
SEAN
Don't call him a monster!
81.
Fat Kid looks to the floor. Eugene and Pete stop pulling. 
They look at Sean with huge, sad eyes.
SEAN
Use your eyes, Fat Kid! Does he 
look like we can help him?
FAT KID
But... what if he's dead...?
SEAN
Then He died to help US.
(a beat, taking control)
Now I’m the head of this squad, so 
listen up. He said Dracula knows 
we're here, so let's just find the 
amulet...
(beat)
...and get the hell out of here.
Sean turns... and tentatively moves down the shadowy hall­ 
way. He looks back to the others, and —
That's when a HAND SHOOTS OUT of nowhere and CLAMPS over 
Sean's mouth. Eugene and Fat Kid SCREAM, as they SEE —
An elderly, BEARDED MAN in a cloak which totally surrounds 
his six-foot plus frame. He puts a finger to his lips.
STRANGER
Ssshh. It's all right. We're on the 
same side.
He releases Sean... who swallows hard.
SEAN
... Who are you?
STRANGER
My name is Van Helsing. Kenneth Van 
Helsing.
FAT KID
Van Helsing? Like the guy who 
fought Dracula?
STRANGER
Abraham, yes. He was my grand­ 
father.
(gestures)
Come. There's not much time...
138 EXT. 50's BURGER DRIVE-IN - NIGHT
82.
RUDY sits at his favorite table next to PATRICK'S SISTER, 
while Patrick himself paces back and forth with a walkie-
talkie.
PATRICK
Come in, Sean... Sean, please 
respond, over.
He looks at Rudy, frightened. Rudy consults "his watch.
RUDY
Ten o'clock. They're late.
PATRICK'S SISTER

Maybe the monsters got them.
Rudy gives her a Jackie Gleason look.
INT. PARLOR - SCARY HOUSE - NIGHT

106
The mysterious stranger lights a lantern, motions for the 
boys to follow him into the creepy PARLOR...
STRANGER
Go ahead, ask me questions.
SEAN
What happened to your grand­ father?
STRANGER
No one knows. He disappeared in 
Europe a century ago. Now listen 
carefully: After World War I, his 
son, my father, came to America. He 
brought with him the diary and the 
amulet, hid them somewhere in this 
house. The amulet is somewhere in 
this house. The amulet is 
surrounded by crucifixes and 
garlic, to ward off vampires. Are 
you getting this?
SEAN
Yeah.
STRANGER
Now, years later, the Prince of 
Darkness has come to America. He’s 
located the amulet, and plans to 
destroy it at midnight. I trust you 
know what happens then.
83.
FAT KID
Yeah, evil rules the world, we 
heard that part.
STRANGER
(nods coldly)
Global Armageddon. The Time of the 
Beast. YOU MUST HELP ME GET THE 
AMULET OUT OF THAT CHAMBER. But 
first, I have to know — are you 
alone? Have you told any grown-ups 
about this place?
FAT KID
Scary German Guy read the diary...
STRANGER
Fine, fine, but is anyone coming to 
the house? Are you children the 
only ones, or is help coming?
SEAN
No help. Just us. And you.
STRANGER
(smiles)
Good.
SEAN
Wait a minute. What chamber?
All of a sudden he sounds SUSPICIOUS. Something's screwy 
here. Across the room, FAT KID has discovered the remains of 
a broken mirror over the mantle. He looks into it.
FAT KID
(voice trembling)
Sean...?
Sean LOOKS, and SEES that:
IN THE MIRROR is his reflection, and Fat Kid's, and of course 
Eugene's, but not, repeat NOT, Van Helsing's —
All we see of Van Helsing is — get this — his face floating 
in mid-air, and in case you haven't guessed — he's not really 
Van Helsing, this guy. In fact, as the kids turn, terrified —
—he peels gooey LATEX from his face... strips off a fake 
BEARD you can tell by the fangs, ripe with saliva...
SEAN
Oh, Christ.
84.
DRACULA
WRONG...
His hypnotic eyes glow red and lock onto Sean's.
FAT KID
Sean! Don't look at him!
Too late.
DRACULA
DO, Sean! DO look at me! Tell me 
what you see...
SEAN
(fighting it)
Evil... I see evil...
DRACULA
You see a reflection... of 
yourself...
Sean's eyes are wide and lifeless, trapped in the vampire's 
spell.
FAT KID
(pointing)
Uh oh! Sun's coming up!
Dracula LOOKS.
FAT KID
You looked.
The trance broken, Sean RUNS — and the other BOOGIE RIGHT 
BEHIND HIM. Dracula watches them go, makes no move to stop 
them. WE PUSH IN TO CLOSE-UP...
And we see a thousand years of death in the vampire's eyes.
DRACULA
You have made the wrong enemy, Sean 
Crenshaw. .. Now neither of us will 
see the sun rise.
INT. HALLWAY - SCARY HOUSE (STEADICAM)
107
107
THE KIDS go screaming out into the hallway at 100 miles an 
hour, arms pumping furiously.
FAT KID
So he's not Van Helsing, right?
85.
They ROUND a bend AND —
WOLFMAN JUMPS into view, blocking their way. They promptly do 
a 180, and RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION.
Wolfman takes off in hot pursuit.
THE KIDS run down the hall, up some stairs, where PATRICK 
does a quick "eeny-meeny-miny-moe" between three doors,
YANKS one open —
PATRICK
IN HERE — !
And in they rush, SLAMMING THE DOOR behind them, just as 
Wolfman SWIPES AT IT, LEAVING CLAW MARKS DEEP IN THE WOOD.
INT. DEAD END ROOM
108
108
And we're calling it that because, guess what? There's NO WAY 
OUT. We hear Wolfman CLAWING and POUNDING from outside.
SEAN
Good one, Patrick! No doors, no 
windows —
PATRICK
Do something!
SEAN
No convenient portals to other 
dimensions!
Pete BARKS his lungs out. Wolfman SHREDS the door in a 
frenzy. The sound is DEAFENING. Eugene is moderately upset.
PATRICK
Do something!!
SEAN
Shut up, just shut up!
FAT KID
Your dad's a cop, you get straight 
A's, THINK OF SOMETHING!!
The Wolfman IMPACTS THE DOOR again and again! Sean closes his 
eyes, presses his hands to his temples.
SEAN
Okay. Okay. Officer in danger, 
Section 22.4...
86.
The door POPS A HINGE, leans dangerously inward...
FAT KID
Come on, COME ON...
(CONTINUED )
And Sean looks up. Cold determination.
SEAN
Kick him in the nards.
FAT KID
What???
SEAN
When he comes through that door, 
we're gonna kick him in the nards 
AS HARD AS WE CAN.
FAT KID
Are you crazy?? He's a werewolf, he 
doesn't have nards!
SEAN
How do you know?! He never takes 
his pants off!!
FAT KID
We're gonna die, we're gonna die —
THE DOOR EXPLODES off its hinges, and in comes Wolfman, 
visibly upset, GROWLING, out for blood, and he raises his 
arms for the kill and Fat Kid is paralyzed, until Sean yells:
SEAN
DO IT.
And with that, Fat Kid hauls off — And slams his foot into 
Wolfman's nards.
Picture this: You tie a rope around a dog's neck, and you tie 
the other end to a huge boulder. You push the boulder off a 
cliff. The rope snaps tight. You know the sound the dog 
makes?
Wolfman makes that very same sound. Then CRUMBLES.
FAT KID
Werewolf's got nards...
SEAN
GO!!
87.
INT. HALLWAY - SCARY HOUSE
109
109
The kids come skidding out into the hall, RUN LIKE THE WIND 
past the Civil war manniquin, toward a DOOR at the very end. 
An exit?
Sean GRABS the knob, WHIPS OPEN THE DOOR, AND —
Remember the lost girls in Dracula’s pantry? Well, last time 
we saw them, he hadn’t gotten to them yet... By now, he has.
Which means they're dead. Which, in vampire terms, means they 
REACH OUT AT US SCREAMING with ugly, horrible vampire faces, 
so the kids WHIRL and RUN BACK the way they came, ROUND A 
BEND, and the kids WHIRL and RUN BACK the way they came, 
ROUND A BEND, and
There's Dracula, COMING THIS WAY.
The kids STOP next to the Civil War soldier. Ahead of them: 
DRACULA. To their right: VAMPIRE GIRLS. To their left: 
WOLFMAN, stumbling down stairs, EXTREMELY pissed. This we 
call a dilemma.
Patrick instinctively GRABS for the soldier’s musket.
SEAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
PATRICK
Haven't you ever read the Hardy 
Boys? You pull this down, and a 
secret door opens!
SEAN
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!
PATRICK
YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?!
He pulls it DOWN... And a secret TRAP door OPENS underneath 
our heroes. They all FALL THROUGH. The door springs shut.

Dust and debris. Three kids and one dizzy dog, covered with 
dirt head to foot. They groan, brush themselves off. Sean 
shines his flashlight around the torch-lit?
chamber.
88.
Or should I say TORTURE chamber: manacles, cages, an iron 
maiden... stuffed goat heads on the walls. This is not a 
place to take the kids on vacation.
Eugene is bawling his eyes out.
FAT KID
Great. Frankenstein's dead, 
Eugene's crying, and there are goat 
heads.
Sean shines his light on SKELETON EXPLORER... then looks in 
the direction he's pointing. He rises, mesmerized, face lit 
by an ethereal light. As he moves forward, it intensifies.
SEAN
Bingo...
He is ooking directly into the NOW-OPEN AMULET CHAMBER.
He approaches it... tentatively ENTERS the vault.
INT. SECRET VAULT
111
111
Sean approaches the alter... surrounded by crosses and garlic 
He reaches out... TAKES the amulet, eyes filled with wonder 
face bathed in the amulet's glow
INT DUNGEON CHAMBER
Sean emerges from the vault, cradling the prize
SEAN
Got it!
And a HAND GRABS HIS WRIST DRACULA BARES HIS FANGS and goes 
for the throat.
FAT KID
SEAN!!
Pete BARKS! EUGENE leaps forward, but Dracula savagely SLAPS 
him away... Fangs bared, he turns, and CLOSES IN ON SEAN...
Now the idea that Fat Kid has is not brilliant. Under the 
circumstances, however, it's pretty sharp. He fumbles in his 
pocket, AS DRACULA'S FANGS get closer to Sean's neck... and 
he pulls out the remains of his PIECE OF PIZZA --
—Then he leaps, and MUSHES IT IN DRACULA'S FACE. As the pizza 
touches, the skin actually SIZZLES, and Dracula RECOILS, 
screeching like a woman, clutching his face in AGONY.
89.
SEAN
(staring)
Garlic...
And that's when Fat Kid grabs him, and they pick up Eugene 
and TAKE OFF the hell out of there, as —
DRACULA staggers in a blind RAGE. As he turns to CAMERA, we 
see that his face is covered with HIDEOUS FIRST DEGREE 
BURNS...
EXT. SHADOWBROOK ROAD - NIGHT
112

Sean, Fat Kid and Eugene stumble to the road, huffing and 
puffing with exertion... Suddenly, HEADLIGHTS STAB out of the 
dark — and a big LAND ROVER lurches to a stop beside them.
AT THE WHEEL IS SCARY GERMAN GUY. PHOEBE SITS BESIDE HIM.
PHOEBE
You guys, I got Scary German Guy to 
help!
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Listen, boys, that old house is 
hardly safe. Why don't we all go 
back tomy house for a piece of pie, 
and —
SEAN SHOVES THE AMULET UNDER SCARY GERMAN GUY'S NOSE.
SEAN
You gotta help us! The book was 
right — LOOK!
There's no denying it, the AMULET is throbbing, and HISSING, 
and shooting off sparks of SUPERNATURAL POWER.
Scary German Guy stares, absolutely thunderstruck.

The ROOKIE COP, the one who was trigger-happy earlier, sits 
flipping through reports. The telephone RINGS. He scoops it 
up.
ROOKIE COP
Police.
RUDY
Hello, I have information about a 
crime. There's been a major cocaine 
war, and, urn, six people are dead. 
Yeah. Did I say size? TEN. 
Shadowbrook Road, send as many men 
as you've got.
ROOKIE
Uh huh. And your name?
RUDY
Send 'em NOW!
He hangs up, runs for his bike.
The cop frowns, hangs up, looks up from his desk. And there's 
DEL CRENSHAW, looking worse than ever. Cigarette dangling
DEL
What was that?
ROOKIE
Ahhh, cocaine war. Six murders. The 
usual.
DEL STOPS. TURNS.
DEL
They give a location?
ROOKIE
Lieutenant, it was a prank. Okay? 
It was a kid's voice —
DEL
DID THEY GIVE A LOCATION?
ROOKIE

pad)

A LIGHT COMES ON BEHIND DEL'S EYES.
DEL
How old did the kid sound —?
ROOKIE
I dunno. Ten? Twelve? I'm telling 
ya, it was a prank —
DEL
Come on.
HE GRABS THE OTHER COP, FLINGS ON A JACKET, HEADING FOR THE

ROOKIE
What's going on?
EXT. ROADWAY - SAME

TWO BIKES go streaking along the pavement: PATRICK, RUDY and, 
on the back of Rudy's bike, PATRICK'S SISTER. All looking 
worried. As they approach a seemingly deserted intersection —
SCARY GERMAN GUY'S land rover comes flying around the corner, 
screeches to a halt beside them. The entire Monster Squad is 
together at last, reunited.
PATRICK
GUYS! Oh, man, am I ever glad to 
see you. We thought —
SEAN
Ssshh. There's not time.
(points)
She a virgin?
PATRICK’S SISTER
Guy — !
PATRICK
Yeah. She is.
SEAN
Okay.
He takes the talisman out of his pocket, and everyone gasps 
at its glowing rainbow BRILLIANCE.
92.
SEAN
We got the amulet, but there are 
monsters after us. We gotta make it 
to the center of town, where there 
are people around.
Everyone scrambles into the land rover.
Sean looks at his watch.
SEAN
Forty minutes ’til midnight. God, 
if we pull this off, I'm gonna 
shit.

There's an old church in the town 
plaza.

And that's when, out of nowhere, DRACULA'S HEARSE BLASTS by 
them, ALSO going 100 miles an hour, heading the other 
direction.
ROOKIE
Black hearse, isn't that... Jesus— 
!
93.
His head bounces off the dashboard as Del stands on the 
brakes, throws the car into a 180 degree skid, leaving most 
of his tires on the road behind him. Heads back the way he 
came.
EXT. SCARY GERMAN GUY'S LAND ROVER - NIGHT
118
118
Driving fast. Trees whipping by. In back, Sean grips the 
amulet, which throbs even BRIGHTER. Looks at his watch:
Twenty minutes to midnight.
In front, Rudy puts an arm around Patrick's sister. She 
elbows him in the stomach, as the car barrels around a corner 
—
AND THE MUMMY STEPS OUT into the road, right smack-dab in 
front of the speeding vehicle.
PATRICK
Shit!
RUDY
Go around him!
Scary German Guy spins the wheel, sending the car into a 
high-speed FISH-TAIL. Rubber burns. Tires screech. The car 
stands on two wheels, comes back down, BAM—!
And roars away, but not before the mummy lunges forward — and 
CATCHES onto the fender — He is dragged behind the car, and 
what does he do? He starts to CLIMB UP THE BACK OF THE ROVER.
Meanwhile, Scary German Guy wipes his forehead with a 
handkerchief. That takes care of that.
Except THEN he looks in the rearview mirror, and sees the 
mummy’s BANDAGE, fluttering behind the car.
And at that very moment the mummy REARS UP in back, snarling! 
FAT KID SCREAMS.
RUDY
SWERVE!
Scary German Guy twists the wheel madly, as the mummy grabs 
PHOEBE by the back of the neck and DRAGS her backward —
He's going to throw her out of the car.
94.
SEAN leaps forward, grabs Phoebe's leg — and the mummy simply 
BACKHANDS him. Sean flies out of the car, catches the roll-
bar, hangs on by the skin of his teeth, and ANOTHER CAR comes 
blaring out of nowhere and narrowly misses them, SPARKS 
flying...
And PETE THE DOG has ahold of the mummy's bandage, growling 
and YANKING for all he's worth...
And that's when Rudy has his brainstorm. Shouts over the 
wind.
RUDY
DRIVE NEAR THE TREE.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
What?
RUDY
THE TREE.
Rudy grabs the LOOSE BANDAGE from Pete the Dog's mouth, 
hauling in the slack... quickly ties the end to one of his 
stolen ARROWS, remember them? And Scary German Guy swerves 
across the centerline, heading right for a big, solid-looking 
OAK —
And Rudy lets fly the arrow.
It imbeds itself in the tree, THWACK --
RUDY
Punch it.
Scary German Guy floors the gas, as Rudy turns to the mummy, 
who is still yanking Phoebe, and he looks the mummy right in 
the eye and says:
RUDY
See you later, band-aid breath.
The ARROW pulls tight, and holds —
And as the car leaps forward the mummy starts to UNRAVEL.
Fast. His bandages go whipping off onto the night breeze, 
until all that's left is a 2000 year-old skeleton with bright 
red eyes, held together by a few strings of flesh.
He disintegrates, bones CLATTERING behind them in the road. 
The car drives on.

HIGHWAY PATROLMEN stand beside their cars, which are parked 
squarely in the middle of the highway. The driver speaks into 
the mike:
ROADBLOCK COP
Corner of Church and Fisk, request 
backup, over.
The HEARSE is BARRELLING closer and closer. It shows no sign 
of stopping.
The highway cops dive for cover as the hearse REACHES THE 
ROADBLOCK, and by all rights, it SHOULD obey physics, SHRED 
METAL, shatter glass, SCRAPE screaming, sparking death off 
the patrol cars as it SLAMS INTO THEM — But it doesn' t.
Instead, like a gust of wind, it simply PASSES THROUGH THEM 
with a soft WHSSHHHH.
The HIGHWAY PATROLMEN watch, slack-jawed, as the ghost car 
disappears into the night. The cop grabs the mike and yells:

repeat, east on Church.

Emily Crenshaw has been crying.
On the table before her are two suitcases, into which she is 
tossing articles of clothing. Packing. She slams shut the lid 
and wipes her eyes with a Kleenex.
Across the room sits the tiny red candle we saw earlier, the 
one which means someone loves you and nothing bad can 
happen... Suddenly, A GUST OF WIND blows through the window — 
and snuffs out the flame.

THE BLACK HEARSE rounds the corner, hops the curb —-and 
lurches to a halt in the Crenshaw yard.
This is where it gets scary; the car door flies open, and out 
comes DRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS.
Removes to the back of the car, and just so we'll know, he is 
INSANE with rage. Not pissed, or peeved, or slightly IRKED, 
mind you. No, this guy is out for blood. So to speak.
He doesn't even bother with a key, he RIPS OPEN the trunk 
with his bare hands. Reaches inside — and pulls out two 
STICKS OF DYNAMITE from the aged satchel.

THERE IS A SCREECH OF TIRES. Dracula whirls AS HEADLIGHTS 
blaze out of the dark, and a Police car plows into the back 
of his hearse. DEL EMERGES. Behind him the rookie fumbles for 
his .38.
Del draws down on the Dark Prince.
DEL
Move and I'll kill you.
Dracula smiles calmly — AND TOSSES THE DYNAMITE AT DEL.
Oops. Del takes a running leap, hurtles into the bushes —
As the police cruiser blows SKY-HIGH, flying into the air and 
slamming back down in two pieces. Flame. Broken glass.
Del rolls into a combat crouch, his face INSANE in the 
flickering firelight, and puts three shots into Dracula's 
chest —
BAM BAM BAM! Dracula smiles coldly and looks into Del's eyes.
DRACULA
I will have your son.
And with that, he transforms INTO A BAT and flies away.
WARP ZOOM ON DEL
As he totters on the brink of insanity. Behind him, the 
rookie cop is, well... possibly over the brink.
Flame. Loud noise. The front door bursts open, and OUT COMES:

Welcome to the end of the film. If you need to get popcorn, 
or use the bathroom, better do it now. 'Cause all hell's 
about to break loose. First, a bit about the town plaza:
On one side of the plaza is an OLD GOTHIC CHURCH. Steeples 
and stained glass windows. It is surrounded by shops and 
stores, a CENTURY 21 office, a BOB'S BIG BOY restaurant, 
complete with loveable Bob statue: overalls, hair you could 
surf on.
Storm clouds are rolling and boiling in the almost midnight 
sky. A few dim flickers of lightning. In the street:
99.
The Land Rover is parked, surrounded by the entire Monster 
Squad, attending to their gruesome midnight business...
SEAN lowers his walkie-talkie, his face betrays a fear deeper 
than any he has ever felt. He looks up toward a huge clock 
face on the municipal building: THREE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT.
SEAN

(Patrick looks up)
All set?
PATRICK
All set.
(CONTINUED )
SCARY GERMAN GUY is standing next to Patrick's sister, 
thumbing through the infamous DIARY. She listens and nods, 
looking pretty much like a cheerleader and not at ALL like a 
monster fighter...
RUDY tugs on the door of the church, finally kicks it in 
frustration.
SEAN
Don't kick the church!
RUDY
It's locked!
SEAN
Fine, we'll do it right here.
FAT KID
Oh, right. We're outside of Bob's

Can't we at least give him a cross

PATRICK'S SISTER
Right, right... okay. Here I go. 
Wait. Um... okay, yeah. Okay. No.

The VAMPIRES draw closer. LIGHTNING cracks down, thunder 
echoes through the chasm of Main Street. The wind begins to 
howl.

thwacks right on through and emerges from her back. She keeps

RUDY
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
He takes out one of his carved wood-stakes. And the vampire 
GRABS HIS ARM.
RUDY
Mellow out, wench.
He plunges the stake into her heart.

Hopping up and down in frustration, stuttering wildly as she 
tries to apply her non-existent grasp of the German language.

Scary German GUy grits his teeth.

Bitte, tuen sie uns nicht weh.
She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath. The wind blows.

them, backlit by the blood-red MOON...
PATRICK'S SISTER
Bitter tunny — aw, shit.
THE BAT COMES PLUMMETING OUT OF THE SKY.
FAT KID

Sean turns — It's headed right for him. Eyes ablaze.
A STATION WAGON CATAPULTS into the intersection, swerves —

103.
The dim interior of a second-story sporting goods ware­ house 
as the window SHATTERS, a rain of glass, and a FORM SAILS 
through — LANDS in a heap in a corner of the room...
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
133
133
Del lurches out of the car, sprints across the street, KICKS 
IN the door of the building —
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
134
134
POUNDS up the stairs, gun drawn — STOPS in the doorway of the 
second-story warehouse, staring in at a form in the shadows, 
in a corner of the room, criss-crossed by moonlight:
A wing. A hand. A claw. The figure begins to stir...
It is a figure HALF-MAN, HALF-BAT... It is DRACULA — CAUGHT 
IN MID-TRANSFORMATION.
Del sucks in a sharp breath, reaches into his jacket— and 
pulls out a stick of dynamite. He LIGHTS IT off his cigarette 
lighter.
DEL
Try this, you son of a bitch.
He raises his arm — HEARS a GRRRR — WHIRLS —
And THE WOLFMAN stands silhouetted in the doorway, fangs 
bared. He JUMPS! KNOCKS Del down — The dynamite flies out of 
his hand, lands on the ground, hissing.
Del gasps for breath, draws his gun — But the Wolfman slaps 
it out of his hand. Picks Del up OVER HIS HEAD, and FLINGS 
him across the room like a rag doll. Del LANDS with a 
splintering CRASH. Tries to roll away.
No dice, Wolfman is right on top of him, grabs him and hurls 
him again. Impact. Pain. Del is barely conscious.
A torrent of blood gushes from his nose.
The DYNAMITE is still hissing furiously.
Wolfman moves in, picks Del up, way, WAY over his head — And 
the audience is saying NO, please, he's had enough — Slams 
Del into the floor. Ribs are breaking here.
104.
Del rolls over, spits blood. Wolfman stands over him, moving 
in for the kill. Del tries to move. Can't. It's all over, 
he's given everything he has and there's nothing left. At 
which point —
A VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, asshole.
Wolfman spins —
SEAN
You looked.
— and Sean slams a BASEBALL BAT into his head. The beast 
SCREAMS, stumbles backward, and as he does — DEL rolls over — 
GRABS the stick of DYNAMITE — SHOVES it into Wolfman’s 
trousers, and pushes hard.
Wolfman pinwheels backward out the broken window.
EXT. WINDOW OF SPORTING GOOD'S STORE
135
135
As he plunges toward the street, HE BLOWS UP in mid-air, 
bloody pieces flying every which way. Applause here, 
maybe...?
BACK INSIDE
Sean grabs his father, hugs him. Del returns the hug, looks 
in the corner — But Dracula is nowhere to be seen.
EXT. STREET - SERIES OF SHOTS
136
136
WOLFMAN'S HAND lands with a thump in the gutter, and then, 
without missing a beat —
It starts to TRAVEL, skidding across the pavement, as —
EXT. IN AN ALLEY - NIGHT
137
137
OTHER PIECES of Wolfman go WHISKING around a corner, into an 
alley, and now, now, we get it, see, only a SILVER BULLET can 
kill Wolfman... And so, before our wondering eyes —
He RE-INTEGRATES, coming together with a WHOOSH of sound.
Good as new. And meaner, definitely a lot meaner...
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
138

105.
Rudy stakes the last of the female vampires. Behind him 
WOLFMAN emerges from the alley, starts loping toward him, 
hard and fast.
And though Rudy doesn't know it, he is about to die.
Until out of nowhere comes SAPIR --
SAPIR
Kid, watch it!
Rudy hits the dirt, as Sapir FIRES — BAM BAM BAM! But Wolfman 
doesn't stop. Doesn't even slow, GRABS SAPIR, starts to tear 
him to shreds.
TWO MORE COPS APPEAR. Wolfman WHIRLS on them, JUMPS!
A spastic eruption of ACTION — GUNFIRE. SCREAMING.
Shredded flesh. Blood. But this is mostly off-screen, since 
WE ARE ON:
Rudy, kneeling over the dying Sapir.
SAPIR
Tell you a secret, kid... I'm a 
lousy policeman.
He dies. Rudy looks up. The Wolfman has KILLED the other two 
cops, and starts toward him. Rudy takes Sapir's gun, reaches 
into the pocket of his jacket, takes out a single, gleaming 
SILVER BULLET... Deadly calm, he loads the shell.
Wolfman approaches, growling. He has tasted blood... and 
wants more... Without a trace of fear, Rudy raises the gun, 
levels off at the Wolfman's heart. His aim is rock steady.
RUDY
Bang.
The gun roars. Wolfman's chest explodes with crimson.
He flies backward, and --
Rolls over, no longer a wolf. Human as the rest of us, and 
dying.
DESPARATE MAN
God, thank you...
He dies.
Rudy stands up, as Sean and Del limp up to him.
106.
We see now that Rudy is slightly shaking.
RUDY
Told you. Only one way to kill a 
werewolf.
EXT. TOWN PLAZA - AS BEFORE

Meanwhile, the other kids are having a time of it. As you’ve 
probably guessed, Patrick’s sister is not real popular.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(through clenched teeth)
Let's...try it again, shall we?
PATRICK'S SISTER
Look, you've got me upset --
They shake their heads.
POLICE CARS PULL UP, SHRIEK to stops — and COPS swarm out, 
but as they try to enter the plaza LIGHTNING FLASHES DOWN, 
and a fissure SPLITS in the asphalt directly in front of 
them.
PATRICK
DO IT! COME ON!
PATRICK’S SISTER
(eyes closed)
Bitte... Bitte... Bitte, tuen sie 
uns nicht weh. Oh, my God, I SAID 
IT.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Good Lord. You did. I have 
absolutely no idea how.
He hugs her. She leaps in the air and does a cheerleader 
yell. PATRICK heaves a sigh of relief.
And nothing happens.
Except a MAN-HOLE COVER blows sky-high, and the CREATURE FROM 
THE BLACK LAGOON RISES from the sewer behind Fat Kid.
PATRICK
Where's limbo? We just went through 
MAJOR SHIT, where1s the big limbo 
thing?
Scary German Guy frowns, points to Patrick's sister.
107.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Are you...sure she's a...um...
Patrick turns to his sister.
PATRICK
Ahem.
(quietly)
You're not a virgin, are you?
His sister shrugs apologetically.
PATRICK
No...? NO?
(shakes her)
What do you mean NO!?!?
PATRICK'S SISTER
Well, Steve, but he doesn't count -
-
The logic escapes Patrick.
PATRICK
Doesn't COUNT??
PATRICK'S SISTER
...Sorry...
PATRICK
I'm gonna murder you.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
I'm afraid you'll have to stand in 
line.
(he points)
THE CREATURE throws aside stray policemen. His tongue 
slithers in and out. Fat Kid stands by helplessly.
PATRICK
Oh. Oh, wow. I...I’m not talking to 
you. I can't believe this. I'm 
upset here.
EUGENE tugs on Scary German Guy's leg. He looks down, and 
Eugene points to PHOEBE: she stands, horrified, clutching Mr. 
Scrap.
EUGENE
Is she a version?
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(distracted)
108.
What...? I — virgin. Yes, VIRGIN.
(he grabs Patrick)
Use the girl.
PATRICK
She can't read!
SCARY GERMAN GUY
I'll help her. QUICKLY.
FAT KID RUNS from around a corner, GASPS. THE CREATURE turns, 
MOVES TOWARD HIM, arms outstretched. Fat Kid backs off, 
trapped, trips over a DEAD RIOT SQUAD cop.
Thinking fast, Fat Kid GRABS the pump shotgun from the dead 
man's hands. Rigor mortis makes the grip hard to break. Fat 
Kid CURSES and sweats. The Creature SHRIEKS ...closing in...
Fat Kid backs to A NEWSTAND with the riot gun. He tries the 
glass door. Locked. He looks in.
INT. NEWSTAND (INTERCUT)
140
140
E.J. and DEREK, cower by the counter inside. Fat Kid YELLS:
FAT KID
E.J., THE DOOR! LEMME IN! OPEN THE 
DOOR!!
E.J. and DEREK do not budge. Chickenshit. Fat Kid BASHES the 
lock with the shotgun butt. It doesn't budge.
Fat Kid turns. The CREATURE is almost upon him.
Finally, he COCKS the shotgun, pivots, and BLOWS the door 
into a CONCUSSIVE SHOWER OF GLASS! He runs in.
E.J.
(lamely apologetic)
I--
Fat Kid AIMS the gun at him. Pure Eastwood. He PUMPS the 
shotgun. Derek SCREAMS. THE CREATURE CRASHES THROUGH THE 
REMAINS OF THE DOOR.; Fat Kid WHIRLS, and FIRES. BOOM! The 
Creature's shoulder is blown off.
This slows him down. Doesn't stop him. Fat Kid COCKS the gun 
again. The Creature is almost on him. E.J.
wets his pants. Fat Kid aims. The shotgun ROARS!
109.
The Creature's chest EXPLODES and he FLIES BACKWARD, hitting 
the ground with finality. A puddle forms around him. Glass 
settles.
Fat Kid approaches the amphibious thing... A fish slips out 
of its mouth, flops about gasping for water.
E.J. sheepishly glances at the stain in his pants. Fat Kid 
turns, shotgun in hand. He notices, says nothing.
Scratch one Creature from the Black Lagoon.
E.J.
...Good job, Fat Kid...
A beat.
FAT KID
My name's Horace.
He PUMPS the shotgun like a pro.
EXT. TOWN PLAZA - BACK TO SCENE

Scary German Guy has the diary, is coaching Phoebe through 
the ritual. He looks up — GASPS.
DRACULA is standing in the middle of the street. Tall.
Proud. Deadly.
Around him, nature is going absolutely BANANAS, the air is 
dancing with CRACKLES of electricity, and even the cops are 
forced to COWER beneath this awesome might.
Dracula doesn’t cower. He starts walking.
DEBRIS is flying, a Century 21 signposts slewing across the 
road --
PHOEBE stutters and stumbles over Old German — DRACULA is 
moving faster. Expression crazed. Utterly WICKED.
SCARY GERMAN GUY
(to Phoebe)
"Ich bitten goert schine —" Don't 
look up, DON'T LOOK UP.
DRACULA, moving faster still. Coming toward them. Thunder 
rolls. Lightning flashes. Behind him the uprooted BIG BOY 
statue goes sailing past, grinning like a buffoon.
A COP runs up to Dracula, tries to stop him. Big mistake.
110.
Dracula grabs an arm and TWISTS. We hear it break. The cop 
FLIES out of the frame.
TWO MORE COPS, trying to get between him and the kids.
The dark prince unleashes a hand — snaps a neck like old 
wood. He PICKS UP the other cop, FLINGS HIM IN THE AIR.
Keeps walking.
Lightning flickers on Dracula's INSANITY, and--
He's right on top of PHOEBE now. Patrick and Fat Kid charge 
forward with wooden stakes. Dracula slams them away with his 
CANE. He smiles down at Scary German Guy, who points with 
trembling finger --
SCARY GERMAN BOY
Nie weider, Nosferatu.
DRACULA
Shut up, old man.
He raises his own hand, and — A BOLT OF ENERGY crackles from 
his fingertip, blowing Scary German Guy backward --
ANOTHER ANGLE - DEL, SEAN, RUDY
running forward, terrified, battling to keep their feet.
Wind lashes at them.
DEL
PHOEBE, GET OUT OF THERE!
ANOTHER ANGLE - EMILY CRENSHAW
running forward until she SLIPS and hits the pavement.
EMILY
PHOEBE — !
Dracula grabs the little girl and LIFTS her in a crushing 
grip. She clutches the AMULET, which is pulsing, and HISSING, 
SPARKING.
DRACULA
The amulet, bitch.
111.
Then his eyes GLOW hypnotically, 
mesmerizing Little Phoebe... Then 
he opens his jaws, revealing razor-
sharp FANGS... and he moves closer, 
hissing, demon canines dripping 
saliva, inches from Phoebe's 
innocent white flesh, and just as 
he is about to bite, and your blood 
freezes, just THEN --
A HUGE HAND grabs his throat, stops him cold. He tries to 
wrench free. CAN'T. Turns, incredulously --
And there stands the FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER.
Dracula's messing with his best friend.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
BOGUS.
He BACKHANDS the Dark Prince.
Impact.
And the audience goes nuts, as Dracula LEAVES HIS FEET, goes 
head over heels through the air at the church -—
And lands impaled atop a huge CRUCIFIX, thrashing and 
screaming and SIZZLING like an overcooked steak.
Frankenstein looks down at Phoebe. He is covered with dirt 
and muck, and his face is caved in. It is quite pitiful.
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER
Face hurts...
He grips Phoebe's hand. She clenches his fingers tightly.
Then — SCARY GERMAN GUY is at Phoebe's shoulder, clutching 
the DIARY --
SCARY GERMAN GUY
Phoebe: Bitte, tuen sie uns nicht 
weh.
PHOEBE
(her eyes never leave the 
monster's)
Bitte, tuen sie uns nicht weh.
Scary German Guy heaves a sigh of relief.
Pause. Pause.
112.
The following special effects stuff happens:
First, there's a spot of intense, dazzling LIGHT which 
appears like a RIP in the middle of the air. Then, it begins 
to SPIRAL, throwing off awesome FLASHES of optically printed 
GLARE ---
And it gets bigger, and BIGGER, while all around we see the 
effect it's having, which is like a giant VORTEX, a WHIRL­ 
POOL in the nighttime air — and guess what? It gets BIGGER...
PEOPLE ARE HANGING ON, clutching at anything stationary, 
because now the VORTEX IS SPINNING, and SUCKING IN anything 
and everything:
Vampire corpses, Bob's Big Boy, glass, benches, CARS, garbage 
cans, the suction is absolutely INTENSE, everyone is holding 
on for dear life --
EMILY is slammed against the fender of a car, semi­ conscious 
—
Sean and Del are wrapped around a lamppost, and THAT'S WHEN — 
DRACULA APPEARS BEHIND THEM, a SMOKING GASH where he was 
impaled by the crucifix, and — he GRABS SEAN, pulls him from 
Del's grasp, and AWAY AS --
They both HIT the ground, rolling and tumbling, being sucked 
toward the intense, twisting VORTEX, about to spend ETERNITY 
together...
And Del lets go.
He is caught like a feather in the wind, tumbling over and 
over, shouting his son's name as he slams down onto the 
pavement -- AND RUDY grabs his arm, stopping him, looking off 
toward --
THE VORTEX
It is like a gaping MOUTH, sucking in anything stupid enough 
to come close; like Dracula’s doing, meanwhile LAUGHING, high 
and insane, as Sean POUNDS at him with his little fists --
Heaving, thrashing, as Dracula STRANGLES him, and mean­ while 
Sean is digging his thumbs into Dracula's EYES and PRESSING 
for all he's worth, it's a move his father taught him--
And we're talking INTENSE. A fight to the death between a ten 
year-old boy and a thousand year-old DEMON.
And Sean is losing.
113.
His eyes start to cloud over, he starts to turn blue, and 
Dracula is LAUGHING LIKE A MANIAC... While Sean is dying.
Choking to death... Until...he remembers that he is, after 
all, the son of a policeman... And a cop's kid does not give 
up.
Ever.
He thrusts out his arm, and grabs Dracula's CANE, yanking 
feebly — Accidentally pushes the BUTTON set into the tip.
Its LIGHTNING ROD snaps open like a switchblade — Goes 
through Dracula's throat with a sickening GLITCH — !
And the Prince of Darkness stops laughing.
He looks down, incredulous. Releases Sean — and an ARM SHOOTS 
AROUND THE VAMPIRE'S NCEK, and YANKS HIM AWAY! —
SEAN ROLLS AWAY, looks up, SEES ---
ABRAHAM VAN HELSING
Yes, dammit, the same one we saw at the very beginning of 
this film, and he's got a NIMBUS of dazzling LIGHT around his 
head, his hair standing on end and CRACKLING with energy, as 
he LEANS OUT OF THE VORTEX.
He gives Sean a thumbs up, and for a brief moment their eyes 
meet. Something passes. Then --
Van Helsing vanishes back into the vortex, dragging DRACULA 
kicking and screaming, still impaled like a butterfly on the 
steel rod. At which point Sean witnesses something mortal 
eyes will never again see:
DRACULA AND VAN HELSING, plunging away into the vortex, end 
over end, FOREVER LOCKED TOGETHER in a death struggle.
The champion of Light, the champion of Darkness.
Sean tries to crawl away, as the vortex hauls him backwards -
And PATRICK grabs his hand, hangs on.
FAT KID has ahold of Patrick and also a sturdy lamppost.
The weather is reaching a frightening CRESCENDO, as --
FRANKENSTEIN starts to slide away, toward the vortex,
while PHOEBE desperately hangs on, anchoring them both to a 
STORM DRAIN. She screams and cries.
114.
EMILY, no longer dazed, SHOUTS:
EMILY
Phoebe, let GO!
She shakes her head no, crying, looks into the long-dead eyes 
of her newest and best friend:
The monster waves good-bye, slowly. A tear runs down his 
battered face...
And Phoebe lets go.
But as the monster is PULLED AWAY — Phoebe unhooks Mr. Scrap 
from his velcro grip around her neck, takes aim --
And tosses him to the monster.
And the monster SMILES
FLIES away into the vortex, end over end, spinning off into 
eternity armed with a stuffed bear and the knowledge that 
someone, at long last, loves him...
AND LIGHTNING FLASHES, as storm clouds roll and boil —
only, now, all of a sudden, they are reversing themselves... 
heading back the other direction -- and the vortex is getting 
smaller, smaller still — until — WITHOUT WARNING — In the 
midst of a HURRICANE of sound --
The vortex winks out of existence.
Just like that. The clouds all recede toward the horizon.
The noise stops. Silence.
THE STREET is a war zone. Everyone who is still alive starts 
to get up slowly, one by one...dazed, unconscious, all of 
them just plain out of it... Silence reigns. Debris sifts 
down on the wind.
SEAN CRENSHAW slowly raises his hand, shakily returns Van 
Helsing's parting thumbs up ---
As gradually, the sound of ROTOR BLADES fills the air, 
breaking the stillness. People help each other to their feet.
EMILY bends over her fallen husband.
SCARY GERMAN GUY picks himself up with obvious distaste, 
brushing the grime from his jacket.
AMBULANCES come screeching into the plaza. Fire trucks.
115.
THE ROTOR NOISE fills the screen as, from out of the sky--
NATIONAL GUARD HELICOPTERS touch down in the center of the 
plaza, and a compliment of SOLDIERS bursts out, armed to the 
teeth --
Followed by a cigar-chomping GENERAL, who dashes forward, 
crouched beneath the rotor wash. Lights FLASH, SOLDIERS take 
up positions, it's a shame that everything dangerous has 
already been taken care of....
GENERAL
Who's Eugene?
EUGENE steps forward, wearing his Ghostbusters T-Shirt, 
staring up with saucer-like eyes. Pete barks happily.
THE ARMED SOLDIERS crowd around Eugene, brandishing automatic 
weapons. The General pulls out a piece of paper: EUGENE’S 
LETTER.
GENERAL
Allright, son, where are they?
EUGENE
Mummy came in my house....
GENERAL
(points)
Which one’s mummy? This one?
FAT KID
is surrounded by townspeople, patting him on the back, 
congratulating him, including E.J. and DEREK... This is more 
attention than he’s had since before he was fat....
And he’s a fucking hero, he deserves every bit of it.
Nearby:
RUDY snakes his arm around Patrick’s sister, and this time 
she does not resist. She smiles knowingly.
PATRICK'S SISTER
Where’s the other copy of that 
picture?
RUDY
(caught)
Um. Home. Under my mattress.
PATRICK'S SISTER
Don’t show it to anybody, okay?
116.
Rudy breaks into a wide grin. She matches it. This is majorly 
hot stuff, folks.
THE CRENSHAW FAMILY is finally together, Del is sitting up 
now and Emily grabs him in a bear hug, crying her eyes out.
DEL
Honey, honey, watch the ribs-- -
And then he hugs her anyway.
Phoebe and Sean are both near tears, crying with joy or 
wonder or some damn thing but whatever it is, it isn't bad.
The bad part is over, at least for another 100 years.
RUDY AND PATRICK
Walk side by side, looking thoroughly worn-out.
RUDY
That was very scary, but excellent.
PATRICK
Definitely.
THE GENERAL
Meanwhile, is damn near apoplectic.
GENERAL
Can someone tell me what the Sam 
Hill is going on?
Sean steps forward.
SEAN
We can, sir.
(indicates the other 
kids)
GENERAL
And who are you?
Sean removes a business card from his pocket, holds it up:
SEAN
We’re the Monster Squad.
He grins, as we BEGIN ON THE CARD — and CRANE UP, and 
away...up into the SKY overlooking the plaza...as BELOW, the 
kids are surrounded by jeeps, and tanks, and now here comes 
the SWAT team, and military CHOPPERS, and as the frame is 
absolutely FILLED WITH STUFF, WE --
117.
CUT TO BLACK
And a wolf HOWLS on the soundtrack.
ROLL END CREDITS.
