BLACK.
ELLEN (V.O.)
(whispered)
Once upon a time...
Beat.
A child’s desperate CRYING is heard, echoing in the night.
INT. COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE. NURSERY - NIGHT
1
1
The crying continues in the darkness of a child’s ornate 
bedroom.
The tears come from a pretty TEENAGE GIRL. White skin, black 
hair, and enormous elfin eyes. Her name is ELLEN. There is 
something supernatural and compelling about her...
She moves to the edge of her bed and clasps her hands 
together in fervent prayer.
ELLEN
Come to me. Come to me: A guardian 
angel, a spirit of comfort – spirit 
of any celestial sphere – anything 
– hear my call.
Now she whispers silently, in her head, to the infinite:
ELLEN (V.O.)
Come to me.
Pause.
ELLEN hears a silvery male VOICE whispering quietly in the 
wind. It grows louder. He speaks in an ANCIENT, 
INDECIPHERABLE LANGUAGE.
She rises from bed like a phantom.
A massive SHADOW emerges from her window.
She walks to it, becoming shrouded in its darkness. It’s as 
if the SHADOW is embracing her. She merges with the 
apparition, inhaling its sweet scent. It is a powerful, 
unknown bliss. Her body trembles.
She levitates, her toes inches above the floor.
SHADOW (V.O.)

(whispered, subtitled)
You are not for the living. You are 
not for human kind.

ELLEN sleepwalks into the night.
SHADOW (V.O.)
(whispered, subtitled)
And shall you be one with me ever-
eternally. Do you swear it?
CLOSE ON: ELLEN, motionless in darkness.
ELLEN
I swear.
SUDDENLY: ELLEN is lying in the garden. The SHADOW presses on 
her... Harder... Harder... Her pleasure turns to pain. Out of 
nowhere, A DARK HAND grabs her throat, attacking her 
violently!
IMAGE (lasting under 12 frames): A horrible, naked, corpse-
like DEMON lets out a diabolical growl, straddling ELLEN!
ELLEN screams as if being stabbed in the heart!
THE NEXT MOMENT: ELLEN is nearly buried in the garden dirt – 
violently seizing.
AUDIO: Music builds to a horrific, blistering orchestral 
climax that would bring Beethoven to his knees in torment.
TITLE: N O S F E R A T U
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. BEDROOM - MORNING – SEVERAL YEARS LATER

CLOSE ON: ELLEN is now a young woman, early 20s. She opens 
her eyes from a NIGHTMARE. She gasps, frozen in bed. She 
takes a beat and realises she is awake. She rolls over, 
reaching to embrace her husband...
ELLEN
Thomas.
But he isn’t there.
ELLEN
Thomas?
3.
She looks across the room: THOMAS HUTTER (mid 20s) is tying 
his cravat before a small mirror. He is very invested in 
tying it well. His back is to her. He’s handsome, if not 
pretty. Kind, determined eyes. He seems entirely unaware of 
the darkness in the world. Their middle-class bedroom is 
cute, with brand new, aspirational furnishing. These help to 
disguise its overall shabbiness.
THOMAS
What’s that, my love?
THOMAS turns to her tightening his knot. ELLEN is frightened.
THOMAS
What is it?
THOMAS goes to her, tenderly.
ELLEN
Nothing. I... I dreamt... I –
THOMAS
Come here. There is nothing to be 
afraid of.
ELLEN wraps her arms around him tight, swooning.
ELLEN
The honeymoon was yet too short!
She tries to bring him into bed. THOMAS falls onto her.
ELLEN
Take off your shoes.
THOMAS
I wish I could stay, my love.
She covers him with kisses. He glows. Their love is pure.
THOMAS
How should I have earned such a 
doting wife?
GRETA the CAT crawls into bed on top of them. THOMAS laughs.
THOMAS
(kind)
Ellen, I have told you not to let 
her into bed. I cannot wear 
anything dark. I’m absolutely 
covered in it.
4.
He takes a few cat hairs off him while ELLEN caresses THE 
CAT.
ELLEN
But Greta loves it here. She wishes 
you to stay, too.
THOMAS
Today is of the utmost importance 
for us.
ELLEN
But one minute more.
THOMAS kisses her. He looks at his watch. He’s later than he 
thought!
THOMAS
I really must be off.
ELLEN gets out of bed and they both brush the cat hair off of 
his frock coat. He pecks Ellen again, quickly.
THOMAS
Goodbye.
He leaves.
HOLD ON: ELLEN, troubled by her dream, cuddling with GRETA.
ELLEN
(whispered)
He has the position already. He’ll 
send him away.
EXT. WISBURG. OLD TOWN – MORNING

THOMAS jogs through a muddy and cramped cobblestone street of 
a bustling Baltic port city. The smell of horse dung, fish, 
and charcoal hangs in the foggy streets. He hops over a pile 
of steaming horse droppings.
EXT. WISBURG STREET. MARKET STREET - MORNING

THOMAS tries to pass through a large herd of CATTLE being led 
to the market square.
He rushes past side street views of the busy CANALS full of 
boats, and lined with towering warehouses, funnelling toward 
the HARBOUR. Workmen holler. Steamboats whistle. Harbour 
bells ring.
5.
Thomas takes a shortcut through one of the old medieval 
passageways.
EXT. PASSAGE/KNOCK’S ESTATE AGENCY – DAY

Thomas emerges from the dark passage, running now.
Before him is a crooked brick building with a stepped gable. 
The sign, in German, reads “Knock & Assoc. Estate Agents”.
INT. KNOCK’S ESTATE AGENCY. RECEPTION - DAY

THOMAS stands out of breath in the old, dark, dusty agency. 
The shop bell is still ringing from his entrance.
TWO OLD CLERKS look up at him through their thick spectacles.
CLERK
You have kept him a quarter hour.
THOMAS removes his hat, bowing slightly to the CLERK. A 
strange laughter is heard from afar.
THOMAS skulks down a dark corridor of profusely piled 
paperwork, anxiously fixing his hair. The menacing LAUGHTER 
getting louder. Thomas slowly opens the door, slightly 
ajar...
INT. KNOCK’S ESTATE AGENCY. KNOCK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

KNOCK is clearly a man of great status and wealth. Yet, he 
seems near a mental breakdown – or has it already begun?
THOMAS
Pray, pardon me, Herr Knock, for my 
–
KNOCK
Your delay is providence, my boy, 
providence! Come in, come in. Still 
preparing the account.
THOMAS watches the goblin-like man scribble at his documents, 
letting out a freakish snicker, like a simmering tea-kettle. 
THOMAS tries to ignore his tick.
KNOCK
You have been contracting with us 
for well over two years now, Herr 
Hutter?
6.
THOMAS
And I thank you, sir, for 
considering me.
KNOCK
When tidings of your recent 
nuptials but reached my ears, I 
knew it was providence. A new 
husband requires new wages.
THOMAS
You are too generous, sir.
KNOCK
Do extend my tardy congratulations 
to your wife.
THOMAS
Thank you, sir.
KNOCK
She is truly a...
(lost in thought)
A nonpareil of beauty. Almost a 
sylph.
The comment makes THOMAS uneasy. He changes the subject.
THOMAS
Yes, thank you, sir... and I am 
most eager to proceed with whatever 
your request, that I might be fully 
engaged with the firm.
KNOCK
Indeed. Providence indeed.
(laughs)
KNOCK blows the pounce off the documents.
KNOCK
I have been entertaining dealings 
with a foreign count. Very old line 
of nobility. Very old. Very... 
eccentric.
(laughs)
He, um, wishes to acquire a home in 
our Wisburg.
THOMAS
Oh yes?
KNOCK
7.
To retire here. He has one foot in 
the grave, as they say.
(laughs)
THOMAS
I should be pleased to escort the 
gentleman, and recommend him to our 
properties.
KNOCK
I have already selected: Grünewald 
Manor.
THOMAS is taken aback.
THOMAS
Forgive me, but is it not, well, a 
ruin?
KNOCK
He seeks an old home and will pay 
generously.
THOMAS
I shall meet him tomorrow, then. 
Nine of the clock?
KNOCK
(laughs)
That is the peculiarity... you see, 
he is yet to arrive. You needs must 
journey... to him. He lives in a 
small country, well east of 
Bohemia.
KNOCK pulls out a large map. THOMAS walks warily to his desk.
THOMAS
I see.
KNOCK
Isolated within the Carpathian 
Alps. The land beyond the forest.
THOMAS examines the map to “TRANSILVANIA.” Just then, he 
notices many strange documents on Knock’s desk, all written 
in a mysterious, foreign alphabet and dripping in red wax 
seals. The seals have the same obscure SIGIL upon them. KNOCK 
notices THOMAS’ wandering eye and slides the documents away 
under a mass of paperwork. He hands the map to THOMAS.
KNOCK
It will be a great adventure for 
you.
8.
THOMAS
Indeed. May not the count execute 
the deed here, when he arrives?
KNOCK
He insists I offer him an agent – 
in the flesh. And he will pay 
handsomely, my dear boy. 
Handsomely! Secure this account and 
you shall have your official 
position in our firm!
THOMAS looks at the map. Excited, and a bit concerned.
THOMAS
Thank you sir. Thank you. I shan’t 
disappoint. And what was the 
count’s name?
KNOCK
Orlok.
KNOCK’S laughter becomes even more unsound. RAIN begins to 
patter on the window.
EXT. WISBURG. OLD TOWN. SIDE STREET – DUSK

THOMAS runs through pouring RAIN, the narrow street 
constricted by pedestrians’ umbrellas. He guards a BOUQUET OF 
LILACS with his top hat.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. PARLOUR – NIGHT
10
10
ELLEN looks despondently at the LILACS. A dripping wet THOMAS 
is on his knee in the dim parlour light.
THOMAS
... and I shall set off tomorrow, 
as it is a six-week journey. 
Harding has generously agreed to 
keep you ‘til my return.
ELLEN is silent, still looking at the flowers.
THOMAS
What?
ELLEN
--
THOMAS
9.
I know, my love, yet I shall be 
home in but three fortnights. Time 
is swift.
ELLEN seems deeply sad.
ELLEN
Why have you killed these beautiful 
flowers?
THOMAS
What?
ELLEN
Nothing.
THOMAS
What are you talking about?
ELLEN
Forgive me.
THOMAS
Let us put them in water.
ELLEN
They will only die in a few days. 
Throw them out.
THOMAS
What?
ELLEN
Throw them out!
Her reaction is extreme.
THOMAS
What is this?
ELLEN
You cannot leave.
THOMAS
What are you –
ELLEN
I must tell you my dream.
THOMAS
Ellen, we have put all of these 
difficulties behind us.
ELLEN
10.
I must!
THOMAS
Please, no more of your childhood 
memories ... the doctors advised –
ELLEN
No... It was our wedding....
THOMAS gives in.
ELLEN
Yet not in chapel walls. Above was 
an impenetrable thundercloud 
outstretched beyond the hills. The 
scent of the lilacs was strong in 
the rain... and when I reached the 
altar, you weren’t there. Standing 
before me, all in black... was... 
Death.
THOMAS shudders, though he doesn’t realise it. ELLEN 
continues, the dream playing vividly in her eyes.
ELLEN
But I was so happy, so very happy. 
We exchanged vows, we embraced, and 
when we turned round, everyone was 
dead. Father... and... everyone. 
The stench of their bodies was 
horrible.
ELLEN ELLEN
And – But I had never been so happy 
as that moment... as I held hands 
with Death.
She cries in THOMAS’S arms, both of them horrified from what 
she just said.
THOMAS
(kind)
Never speak these things aloud. 
Never. It is a trifle. A foolish 
dream, just as your past fancies.
THOMAS tries to soothe her.
THOMAS
Everything is well.
ELLEN
It portends something awful for us.
11.
THOMAS
Ellen, we are already wed! What 
could be amiss? Look, when I return 
I will finally make something of 
myself –- I shall buy us a fine 
house of our own, with a 
maidservant --
ELLEN
We needn’t any of that!
THOMAS
I wish you to have all you deserve 
of --
She becomes desperate, wanting to protect her husband!
ELLEN
You mustn’t leave, I love you too 
much!
INT. COACH - NIGHT

ELLEN and THOMAS don’t look at each other. Their argument 
racing in their heads. Silence. Tension. ELLEN pets GRETA.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. REAR DRAWING ROOM – NIGHT
12
12
FRIEDRICH HARDING (late 20s) explodes with laughter!
HARDING
Pray stop, stop! Never since our 
school days, Tom!
THOMAS laughs too, both near the mantel over a roaring fire. 
HARDING pours yet another glass of brandy as he and THOMAS 
smoke their cigars. The old friends lean on one another, a 
bit drunk and sweaty, in their evening attire. HARDING is as 
stalwart and confident as HUTTER is eager and anxious.
HARDING
From my grandfather. The best.
THOMAS
Oh, I oughtn’t –
HARDING
It’s worth celebrating your 
adventure! I envy you.
THOMAS
12.
I envy you. You’ve truly taken your 
father’s place now... it’s 
incredible.
HARDING
The bloody responsibility. It’s 
crushing, Thomas, crushing. Of 
course, It’s unseemly to complain 
with the earnings, but the demands 
of the market grow faster than the 
damnèd shipyard. And my two 
girls... two Tom... I... I love 
them more than the world... Yet 
I...
THEY look through the doorway at ANNA (20s), his lovely wife, 
who shares her husband’s affirming resilience. Her thoughtful 
eyes are full of warmth and zeal. She sits on a divan talking 
with ELLEN who sits on the floor playing with HARDING’S two 
daughters CLARA (6) AND LOUISE (4), and their HEAD NURSE 
(40s). Their house is decorated in the latest, most expensive 
and luxurious decors. Two liveried SERVANTS stand by.
HARDING
Speak none of this to Ellen, or my 
Anna, but we have another on the 
way...
THOMAS
Congratulations!
They drink, then foolishly pour another round.
THOMAS
You always were a rutting goat.
HARDING
I cannot resist her. And when will 
you two newlyweds – ?
THOMAS
When I am no longer a pauper. 
Friedrich, when I have, I mean to 
say... I shall finally be able to 
return the monies you loaned me –
HARDING
Not another word.
THOMAS
And Friedrich...
13.
THOMAS grows more serious. Concerned. He watches ELLEN. She 
looks angelic playing with the children, and their paper 
dolls.
THOMAS
Do take care of Ellen... She nearly 
begged me to remain here.
HARDING
And toss aside your fine 
opportunity?
THOMAS
I fear her past... melancholy 
returning.
HARDING puts his arm lustfully around THOMAS.
HARDING
Naturally! Her dashing young 
husband is leaving her bedside 
cold!
ANNA stands.
ANNA
My sweet ones, it’s time now for 
bed.
HARDING
Pardon us. I am to hunt a monster!
ANNA
(to her husband, teasing)
You are a perfect child yourself.
THOMAS follows HARDING into the...
FRONT DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
13
13
ANNA and HARDING laugh, bringing the children upstairs to bed 
as they scream bloody murder. HARDING carries CLARA on his 
back, playing. He clearly is a doting father.
THOMAS goes to ELLEN, on the floor. They are alone. He holds 
her close. His drinking has disarmed him.
THOMAS
(whispered)
Forgive me.
ELLEN
14.
I have put these fancies behind me. 
I have. And we have each other.
ELLEN looks at him with a hungry love. Her breast looks 
beautiful. THOMAS kisses it. They embrace. They kiss 
passionately. ELLEN begins to crawl on top of him. She digs 
her hands into his hair, her nails into his scalp.
THOMAS
(whispered, gently)
You’re hurting me.
“Shhh” she says softly, lulling him in.
CLARA (O.S.)
NOOO!! The monster, he’ll kill us!
THOMAS & ELLEN continue their deep kiss on the floor. CAMERA 
PUSHES INTO THE SWIRLING BUN OF ELLEN’S BLACK HAIR. CLARA & 
LOUISE cry horribly, louder and louder.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM – NIGHT

ELLEN sits at the dressing table. THOMAS is sleeping behind 
her in his clothes.
Ellen holds a SILVER, HEART-SHAPED LOCKET, and opens it. She 
snips a small LOCK OF HER BLACK HAIR and puts it in the 
locket. She looks in the mirror, forlorn. It is eerie.
Hold. Dissonant music builds...
INT. DARK ROOM (KNOCK’S OFFICE) - THAT SAME MOMENT 15
15
15
A NAKED OLD MAN is on his haunches within the centre of a 
HEPTAGRAM painted on crooked floorboards. It is adorned with 
“mysterious symbols” (like the ones on Knock’s documents). 
Incense and tall black candles burn.
The old man is HERR KNOCK. He digs a sharp quill into a vein 
in his arm, extracting BLOOD, as ink. He is sexually aroused 
by the pain. On an altar before him is a wax tablet. Engraved 
on it is the same SIGIL from the seals. KNOCK applies his 
blood within the grooves of the sigil. He falls into a 
trance, incanting in an ancient language. His eyes roll.
KNOCK continues his incanting, the smoke from the incense 
grows more dense... jolts, he has made contact with something 
... KNOCK speaks with great reverence:
KNOCK
15.
Your lordship. It is entirely as 
you have demanded of me. He shall 
presently be in thy rule, and I 
shall attend thee here, near the 
object of thy contract!
SUDDENLY a terrible burst of wind gusts, exploding into the 
room!
EXT. HARDING HOUSE – DAWN
16
16
The dawn is a somber copper. THOMAS is a little hung over and 
anxious. He stands by his HORSE. ELLEN goes to him. She holds 
GRETA, the cat, who plays with THE LOCKET.
ELLEN
I am proud of you. I...
(she thinks of her 
premonition)
Please keep safe.
THOMAS
(teasing, not defensive)
Have you so little faith in me?
ELLEN kisses THE LOCKET and attaches it to his watch-chain.
ELLEN
I will send you my utmost faith and 
you will write to me every day.
THOMAS
I shall.
ELLEN looks at him with intensity.
THOMAS
I promise.
He looks over at HARDING and ANNA in the open doorway. 
HARDING gives THOMAS a knowing, affirming nod. They both 
wave, “Safe journey!”
THOMAS and ELLEN embrace. She doesn’t want to let go.
THOMAS
Remember, it’s all for us. I love 
you.
A small kiss. It’s not enough for ELLEN.
THOMAS mounts his HORSE and rides off into the misty dawn, 
the capulets on his long coat flapping in the wind.
16.
HOLD ON: ELLEN, her premonition grows.
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF WISBURG - MORNING
17

THOMAS rides through the last remaining semblance of Wisburg, 
out into the vast countryside. The sails of all the old 
WINDMILLS turn in unison, glowing from the eastern horizon – 
where Thomas is heading.

EXT. TRANSYLVANIAN VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS – DUSK - 2 WEEKS LATER20
20
20
Light snow falls. The season has changed. A very weary THOMAS 
has come to a mountain crest. In the valley below him is a 
small thatched VILLAGE with a wooden church. He can smell the 
comforting aroma of the smoke from the burning hearths. Sheep 
wander around him. THE SUN SETS behind the endless mountains. 
THOMAS rides into the valley. The sheep follow. Manic Balkan 
music echoes in the hills.
EXT. TRANSYLVANIAN INN - DUSK
21
21
THOMAS dismounts and walks toward an INN with a bizarrely 
tall pitched roof.
A lively ROMA CAMP with tents and wagons is in the yard. 
Music. Dancing. (”Gypsies” as Thomas would designate them in 
his period.)
As THOMAS approaches, he is swarmed by ROMA CHILDREN and OLD 
WOMEN, all tugging on his clothes and talking non-stop in 
Romany. A rough STABLE-GROOM takes his HORSE. As THOMAS tips 
him, the children go wild! In a panic, he drops a few coins 
from his purse.
As the mayhem increases, THOMAS sees a tall, HANDSOME ROMA 
MAN (45) STARING AT HIM. He smokes his pipe in the shadows of 
the porch of the inn, wearing a rakish hat and a dense black 
beard. His eyes seem to look into Thomas’ soul.
HOLD ON: THE HANDSOME ROMA MAN SMILING.
17.
THOMAS looks away, embarrassed, awkward. Just as he does, THE 
HANDSOME ROMA MAN begins to laugh at him. He laughs and 
laughs showing his beautiful gold teeth. Thomas doesn’t know 
what to do, or why he caused this. All the Roma, young and 
old, begin laughing at him.
Just then, THE INNKEEPER comes to Thomas’ rescue and shoos 
the Roma away, shouting under his gigantic white moustache. 
The mocking laughter continues.
INNKEEPER
(Romanian, subtitled)
You bring trouble with you.
THOMAS
Forgive me, I ... I only wish to 
stay one night. I have an audience 
at the castle. Castle Orlok, beyond 
the Árnyék Pass. I wish to hire a 
coach, or yet a guide to–
THE INNKEEPER grows more stern. Is he afraid?
INNKEEPER
Go.
HANDSOME ROMA MAN
(Romany, subtitled)
Return to your country, Gadjo!
All the Roma shout and laugh. THE INNKEEPER shouts “Quiet” 
and curses them in Romanian.
THOMAS
I am weary, I pray you.
INNKEEPER
(Romanian, subtitled)
Leave here.
Thomas holds up his purse.
THOMAS
I will pay double the board!
INT. TRANSYLVANIAN INN – NIGHT
22
22
THE INNKEEPER’S WIFE, a tiny woman with a witch-like face, 
leads THOMAS through a dark tavern, thick with pipe smoke. 
Chickens mill about.
She leads him past the few patrons in their exotic garb of 
sheepskins, embroidery, and coin jewellery.
18.
They eye Thomas, suspiciously.
She leads him past old women anointing the windows with 
garlic, praying...
She leads him further into a dark corridor...
Further into darkness... Her candlestick flickering as she 
mutters fearfully in Romanian...
Thomas grows uneasy...
INT. INN. ROOM - CONTINUOUS
23
23
THE INNKEEPER’S WIFE has led THOMAS into a primitive, cramped 
room with an unusually tall bed.
Speaking Romanian, she implores THOMAS not to go to Orlok’s 
castle, so it seems.
She places a humble wooden CROSS pendant in his hand.
INNKEEPER’S WIFE
(Romanian, subtitled)
Beware his shadow.
She passes her hand over his eyes. Slowly.
INNKEEPER’S WIFE
(Romanian, subtitled)
The shadow covers you in nightmare. 
Awake, but a dream. There is no 
escape. Pray. Pray.
As she leaves, she crosses herself, and spits on the floor.
She continues praying and mumbling, almost crying in her 
concern.
She’s made an impression. THOMAS grasps THE CROSS tightly ...
No, it’s superstitious nonsense. He puts it on the candle 
stand.
INT. INN. ROOM - NIGHT

THOMAS is awakened by a loud noise. Animals. Singing.
He looks out the window: a procession of FLAMING TORCHES.

THOMAS watches as a group of ROMA with torches walk into a 
grove of birch trees...
He follows, staying in the shadows.
EXT. BIRCH GROVE - NIGHT

THOMAS watches as THE ROMA follow a NUDE TEENAGE GIRL RIDING 
ON A WHITE HORSE.
THOMAS breathes heavily at the sight of her smooth, dark 
flesh, bouncing on horseback. He averts his eyes, 
embarrassed.
OLD ROMA WOMAN
(Romany, subtitled)
Bless this virgin child. Bless her. 
Guide our stallion to the unclean 
spirit.
THE HANDSOME ROMA MAN has a BLACK DOG on a leash. THE DOG has 
a SECOND SET OF EYES painted on its head in white. It barks 
ferociously, foaming at the mouth.
THE NUDE GIRL has led them to a GRAVE in the middle of the 
grove.
EXT. BIRCH GROVE - LATER

THOMAS crouches behind a tree, watching the Roma EXHUME A 
BLOATED ROTTING RED-FACED CORPSE! The women chanting, 
praying, crying.
OLD ROMA WOMAN

Find his tail! His cloven hooves!
THOMAS breathes heavily in fear and disbelief.

THE HANDSOME ROMA MAN POUNDS AN IRON STAKE INTO THE CORPSE’S
NAVEL! THE CORPSE SCREAMS IN PAIN!(Is it alive?)
THOMAS SHOUTS WITH FORCE:
THOMAS
No, by the grace of God!
20.
THE ROMA MAN turns... He locks eyes with THOMAS... 
Suddenly...
INT. INN. ROOM - MORNING
29
29
THOMAS wakes in a sweat. A rooster crows.
THE CROSS from Innkeeper’s wife is around his neck. He takes 
it off and throws it to the floor, in terror - he didn’t put 
it on.
Then he sees... he is wearing his boots, CAKED IN FRESH MUD.
EXT. INN – MORNING

THOMAS walks outside. No one is there. Straw mattresses air 
out on the porch rail. The gypsy camp has gone. Extinguished 
fires smoulder. His horse is gone too.
THOMAS
Hello?
Pause. Nothing.
THOMAS
My horse!?
His voice echoes.
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
31

A brooding Carpathian landscape of oppressive gloom.
THOMAS hikes with a stick up a steep, misty mountain side. 
His saddle bag is slung over his shoulder. The dark and heavy 
atmosphere seems to drag THOMAS’ limbs down.

EXT. ÁRNYÉK/UMBRA PASS - DUSK
33
33
THE SUN sets as THOMAS stumbles up a rugged peak. In front of 
him are the remains of a WOODEN SHRINE at the edge of a 
bridge that crosses a perilous ravine. There is a freakish 
mess of weathered crosses, icons, garlic flowers, and thorned 
wreathes nailed all over THE SHRINE.
21.
THOMAS is afraid to pass. But it calls to him. The wind 
howls. He closes his eyes and steps forward. His heart 
pounds. He crosses the bridge.
EXT. FOREST CROSSROADS - NIGHT
34
34
THOMAS comes to a crossroads within a primeval forest. Snow 
is falling. Wolves howl in the distance.
Then, he hears something more grave. A horrible pounding of 
hellish hooves. An ethereal jingling. Through the tall pines, 
he sees something black, silhouetted by the moon. It is a 
CARRIAGE drawn by four black horses. Their long manes, 
plumes, bells and tassels float in the air weightlessly.
THOMAS recoils in terror as the ghostly CARRIAGE heads 
straight toward him. Closer... closer... it will trample him 
to death... He holds up his arms to guard himself from the 
imminent collision... the horses scream...
SUDDENLY: THE CARRIAGE has halted before him. Utterly still.
THOMAS looks on in wonder. He can’t see a driver. If there is 
one, he is still and silent as the ferryman of the river 
Styx. JUST THEN, THE ORNATE CARRIAGE DOORS OPEN, beckoning 
him. THOMAS enters as if lifted into it by an unseen force.
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT
35

The crack of a whip! THE CARRIAGE moves like a banshee 
through the falling snow.
Huge, muscular BLACK WOLVES chase the carriage, growling and 
howling in excitement.
THE CASTLE stands on the crest of a jagged mountain.

THE CARRIAGE rumbles across the crumbling drawbridge.
INT/EXT. GHOST CARRIAGE – NIGHT
37
37
THOMAS suffocates inside the coach, as if it were a 
mouldering coffin. He closes his eyes in delirium.
EXT. CASTLE ORLOK. BARBICAN GATE - NIGHT
38
38
22.
THOMAS opens his eyes: He has exited THE CARRIAGE. How? He 
cannot remember. It has vanished into the night with the 
wolves. He stands before two great wooden DOORS covered in 
grotesque ironwork.
Before THOMAS can knock, THE DOORS open, creaking and 
moaning. He walks into the dark ruins.
EXT. CASTLE ORLOK. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
39
39
THOMAS looks ahead... in the distance, within the dense fog, 
is A MAN standing in the moonlight. He is too far away for 
THOMAS to make him out, but his presence is magnetic. He is 
deathly pale. His fierce eyes pierce through the darkness.
The figure walks slowly, as if hindered by rigour mortis. He 
is too tall, supernaturally thin, and dressed entirely in 
black. His clothing is rich, elegant, Eastern – the finery of 
a Hungarian nobleman. It is COUNT ORLOK. He stands many paces 
away from THOMAS - utterly still, like a statue.
THOMAS bows. ORLOK looks at him. His eyes tear into THOMAS.
Pause.
ORLOK turns away slowly. He walks back into an abyss of 
darkness... into the castle. THOMAS, stunned, exhausted, 
follows...
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. STAIRCASE – NIGHT
40
40
THOMAS treads well behind ORLOK, up the steep winding stairs.
ORLOK speaks with an impossibly deep sepulchral voice, 
shrouded in the exotic accent of his mother tongue. In spite 
of its power, it seems every word he utters causes him great 
pain and effort to expel.
ORLOK
You are late. The midnight hour is 
passed and my attendants have all 
retired.
THOMAS
Forgive me, Count.
THE COUNT disappears. THOMAS is startled, where did he go? He 
keeps walking... past a stone column he finds an open door...
INT. GREAT HALL. CASTLE ORLOK – CONTINUOUS
41
41
23.
A few candles flicker in the vast Gothic hall. Wind screeches 
through the cracked lead glass windows. It is frigid, 
mildewed, and bleak. A nightmare castle.
THOMAS sees ORLOK standing some distance away, motionless, 
almost entirely hidden in shadow. THOMAS can only hear his 
breath. It is loud and asthmatic – pained, like his speech.
In between them is a huge medieval TABLE, decked with a 
feast. For Thomas alone.
ORLOK
Leave there your conveniences. Set 
out the deed. And sit.
THOMAS
Would you not wish to wait ‘til 
morning?
ORLOK
(overlapping, harsh)
I wish you to do as I request.
THOMAS
Yes, of course, sir.
THOMAS goes to put his satchel down on the table.
ORLOK
Lord.
THOMAS
Pardon me, sir?
ORLOK
Your Lord. I will be addressed as 
the honour of my blood demands it.
THOMAS
Yes, my lord. Forgive me, my lord.
THOMAS is very embarrassed, he’s fouling up already, he’s so 
tired, disoriented. He puts his things down fearfully.
ORLOK
Pray, sit.
THOMAS sits. He feels as if he is being studied by ORLOK.
THOMAS
Thank you, my lord.
24.
With THOMAS very far from him, ORLOK takes the papers. THOMAS 
watches THE COUNT move in a strange and animal-like manner. 
His back is hunched, but in spite of his extremely lean 
profile, his chest is strong, masculine, even bull-like. His 
rich clothing is worm-eaten and filthy. ORLOK continues to 
keep his face hidden from THOMAS.
ORLOK
I am most impatient to bring my 
eyes to your covenant papers and my 
correspondence with your 
proprietor, Herr Knock. I have long 
awaited them, and I hold matters I 
must attend to upon the morrow.
THOMAS
Yes, of course, my lord.
As THOMAS reaches for some food, he realises THE COUNT is 
right behind him! How did he get there?
THE COUNT’S breath is fetid. THOMAS recoils. He doesn’t see 
ORLOK’S arthritic, mummy-like hand reaching for an ancient 
decanter. ORLOK’S long fingernails crawl up the handle like a 
spider. He pours the wine into THOMAS’ chalice.
ORLOK
Drink.
By the time THOMAS has turned to his cup, ORLOK has 
disappeared again into the dark. THOMAS hears him walking to 
the other side of the table, he can’t see him. Suddenly... 
ORLOK is seated in an intimidating, throne of a chair.
As ORLOK pores over the documents, THOMAS tries to make out 
his face in the dim light. His features are anorexic, severe, 
and bestial, and he wears the traditional moustache of the 
region. Yet, however cadaverous and feral – he is somehow 
quite handsome. Anything more than that, THOMAS cannot see. 
THOMAS tries to think of something to talk about. His host is 
most unsettling in his silence.
THOMAS
I have... my lord, I have questions 
about the, um, unfamiliar customs 
of the peasantry and, um, errant 
wanderers...
ORLOK reads on, without a sound.
THOMAS
25.
Last night, I saw, or rather I 
believe I saw a band of gypsies... 
they ventured to a small birch 
grove, and –
ORLOK
Yesternight was but the eve of 
their Szent András. Our common 
people say it is the darkest 
witching night when Devil’s magic 
bids the wolf to speak with tongues 
of men, and every nightmare freely 
treads upon this earth, ascendent 
from the torturous grave.
This does not comfort THOMAS. ORLOK lets out a 
Mephistophelian laugh.
ORLOK
I fear we yet keep close many 
superstitions here that may seem 
backward to a young man of your 
high learning.
THOMAS
These gypsies, they exhumed a 
corpse.
ORLOK
It is their filthy ritual.
THOMAS
What manner of ritual –
ORLOK erupts with unexpected anger:
ORLOK
Speak not of it again!
His voice echoes through the high vaulted ceiling. Birds (or 
are they bats?) flutter in the silence. ORLOK calms, he 
continues.
ORLOK
How I look forward to retiring to 
your city of a modern mind, who 
knows nothing of... nor believes 
any such morbid... fairy tales.
THE COUNT sits still in his chair, his eyes locked on THOMAS. 
Hungry. THOMAS sits still as well. Petrified.
ORLOK
Eat.
26.
Doing as he is told, he awkwardly begins to slice some bread. 
When can he leave the table and sleep!? ORLOK keeps staring, 
still as death.
ORLOK
You are married, Herr Hutter – ?
Just as Thomas feels a chill from that question – the loud 
chime of a clock strikes “four” – he flinches from the sound! 
HE CUTS HIMSELF! ORLOK’S eyes shift to THOMAS’ hand: BLOOD!
ORLOK
Take heed what you do.
THOMAS
It’s nothing.
ORLOK’S breathing grows louder... Louder...
ORLOK
I might ease your wound.
THOMAS senses ORLOK’S animal instinct and guards his thumb – 
a reflex. He is immediately embarrassed by it, and lets go...
ORLOK stands slowly. His savage breathing growing... He walks 
toward THOMAS with dread intent... THOMAS is motionless, 
shaking with fear... what is happening?
BLOOD drips from his finger... ORLOK’S eyes sear into 
THOMAS... THOMAS breathes... ORLOK stops about six feet away, 
still obscured in darkness. He is consumed with bloodlust... 
But he must remain in control.
ORLOK
Come by the fire. Your face shows 
you unwell.
ORLOK leads THOMAS to two armchairs by an enormous fireplace 
that somehow casts little light.
THOMAS is sweaty, losing his grip on reality... He falls into 
the chair... THE COUNT stares at him hypnotically...
THOMAS is moving in and out of consciousness... THE TWO 
GARGOYLES SUPPORTING THE STONE MANTEL START TO MOVE... THEY 
LOOK AT THOMAS... THOMAS gasps...
IN DARKNESS, ORLOK APPROACHES HIM... HE BRINGS UP HIS ARMS...
THOMAS lets out a silent scream... ORLOK LUNGES AT HIM, 
ENVELOPING HIM IN DARKNESS!
27.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM - MORNING
42
42
ELLEN takes her WEDDING DRESS out of a trunk. She holds it up 
with intense love and melancholy. She buries her face in it.
She smells it, deeply. Hold.
She smells it again.
ANNA (O.S.)
Why ever did you bring that here?
ANNA has been standing in the doorway. She looks concerned.
ELLEN is embarrassed. She fumbles with the dress.
ANNA
Forgive me, I know you miss him. 
But, I daresay, you must put that 
away. Really, Leni.
ELLEN moves from embarrassment to shame. ANNA feels guilty.
ANNA
Leni, what might we do for you?
ELLEN
Tell me a letter from Thomas has 
arrived.
ANNA
You received one within a 
fortnight.
ELLEN
That was yesterday.
ANNA
He doubtless just arrived himself.
ELLEN
(overlapping)
He said he’d write to me everyday.
ANNA
The post would most surely be 
delayed from that strange part of 
the world.
Pause.
ANNA
What can cheer this poor humour, my 
love?
28.
ELLEN
I should wish to go to the shore.
This request strikes ANNA as strange.
ANNA
Leni, it is now December.
ELLEN grows in excitement.
ELLEN
It calms me to see the ships sail 
into port. Please? We must bring 
the children along! Please, my pet, 
it will be delicious fun!
ELLEN is beaming. Her excitement is almost discomforting.
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. GREAT HALL – MORNING
43
43
THOMAS opens his eyes. He lies on his stomach, twisted up on 
the cold stone floor. He groans. As he gets up, he realizes 
his tie is undone.
His collar flaps down to the side, his shirt is somewhat 
open. Flecks of blood on his linen tie... What the devil? He 
moves... He has a pain in his chest.
He walks through the hall. It’s quite dark, even in daylight.
THOMAS
Hello?
The castle is in ruins. Covered in debris and rubble, as if 
no one had lived there in a hundred years.
THOMAS
Count?!
His voice echoes. Where are the servants? Where is everyone?
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. CORRIDOR - DAY
44
44
THOMAS wanders the castle trying to find someone, anyone. He 
fills with dread as he turns every deserted corner. The 
anxious atmosphere is dream-like.
He continues through corridors of stone. Every door is LOCKED 
shut. The atmosphere becomes even more oppressive.
At last: a room with a door ajar. Fearfully, he enters...

INT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
47
47
It is a bedchamber. Gothic. Filthy. His overcoat and other 
belongings are all there. But he doesn’t see them.
He walks in, opening up his shirt... headed to a tenebrous 
MIRROR on the wall... Impelled toward it... He hears the 
sound of one or two scuttling, screeching RATS.
He looks at his murky reflection: There is a triangular BITE 
MARK ON HIS CHEST, OVER HIS HEART. Like a rat bite, only 
larger.
A RAT runs past THOMAS’ feet. And another. He feels violated 
– horrified. Another RAT runs by... THOMAS drops the mirror! 
SUDDENLY...
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER CHAMBER. BED - NIGHT/SCRIPT DAY 748
48
48
THOMAS wakes in a cold sweat! He is lying in the dusty canopy 
bed. Was it a dream? How did he get here? He looks down: THE 
BITE MARK IS STILL THERE.
EXT. ESTUARY - DAY
49
49
ANNA and ELLEN walk arm in arm, among IRON GRAVE MARKERS near 
the shore of the muddy bay. They are in their warm shawls, 
bonnets, and parasols. A vast SUNSET behind them. THE 
CHILDREN play with their HEAD NURSE attending nearby.
ANNA
(calling out)
Be careful now, children, keep from 
that filth!
ELLEN is lost in thought watching the distant ships.
ELLEN
Do you ever feel, at times, as if 
you were not – as if you were not a 
person?
ANNA
30.
Well... I...
ELLEN
What I wish to say is that you are 
not truly present nor alive, as if 
you were at the whim of another... 
like a doll, and someone or some 
thing had the power to breathe life 
into you, to move you?
ANNA doesn’t understand. In fact, Ellen’s words frighten her 
a bit, but she wants to be supportive.
ANNA
Well, of course I – we all feel out 
of sorts, set apart, at times. 
Small or... alone.
ELLEN
It’s not out of sorts.
ANNA
(on her heels)
God.
ANNA looks at her intensely. ELLEN smiles.
ELLEN
No, my lovely Anna – I... Look at 
the sky!
She fills with passion.
ELLEN
Look at the sea! Does it never call 
to you? Urge you? Something is 
close at hand-
ANNA
That is his power. A gentle breeze 
from Heaven–
ELLEN
(overlapping)
Destiny!
She stares off into the horizon, the light igniting her eyes.
ANNA
My sweet romantic.
All of a sudden, ELLEN’S eyes fill with fear. Tears well up.
ELLEN
31.
I am not mad, Anna.
ANNA
Leni!
ELLEN
Forgive me. Everything I say sounds 
so childish.
ANNA
Leni, your words spring from your 
honest heart.
ELLEN
My heart is lost without my Thomas.
HOLD ON: ELLEN pining... but not for God.
INT. LIBRARY. CASTLE ORLOK – NIGHT
50
50
ORLOK signs a document written in “the mysterious symbols.” 
And another in German. A lithograph of Grünewald Manor, is 
also on the table. Even as an illustration it’s a looming 
vulture of a building.
THOMAS has become pale, sickly. He looks almost like a child 
standing awkwardly in the cavernous library. He coughs.
ORLOK, again, has his face hidden in shadow.
ORLOK
And your signature, as solicitor.
THOMAS
How careless of me, my Lord.
THOMAS looks at the strange alphabet. He hesitates...
ORLOK
The language of my forefathers.
THOMAS coughs.
THOMAS
Of course.
As he leans in to sign, his SILVER HEART-SHAPED LOCKET 
dangles from his watch-chain. It catches the light. Like a 
predatory bird, ORLOK sees it immediately.
ORLOK
A maiden’s token, I see. Your 
bride?
32.
THOMAS looks up and begins to tuck THE LOCKET away back into 
his waistcoat.
THOMAS
Oh, just so. It... yes.
ORLOK extends his hand for THE LOCKET.
ORLOK
May I?
Pause. THOMAS feels this to be odd. Very odd. But Orlok keeps 
his hand extended.
THOMAS
Of course.
Anxiously, THOMAS unclips it, and hands it to ORLOK.
ORLOK breathes heavily, walking away from THOMAS. He follows, 
afraid to get too close to THE COUNT. He sees ORLOK hold the 
open LOCKET in his withered palm... THE LOCK OF ELLEN’S HAIR 
WITHIN. ORLOK is transfixed.
THOMAS
We are newly married, of late. 
Incidentally, I have letters to her 
I would post – If I may?
ORLOK smells THE LOCKET, remembering...
ORLOK
(to himself)
Liliac.
THOMAS
What was that, my lord?
ORLOK’S breathing is carnal. Beat. He controls his emotions.
ORLOK
You are fortunate in your love.
THOMAS is more uncomfortable.
THOMAS
Providence, as Herr Knock would 
say.
ORLOK
Your signature....
THOMAS is motionless, for there was an unmistakable threat to 
Orlok’s cadence. ORLOK senses Thomas’ hesitation.
33.
ORLOK
I pray you will indulge my pardon.
ORLOK takes out a bejewelled CHEST from the darkness. He 
opens it with a skeleton key, and withdraws something. He 
tosses a heavy velvet purse on his table, overfull with solid 
gold coins from antiquity. A few spill out, glittering.
ORLOK
I durst not neglect your 
commission, Herr Hutter.
THOMAS marvels at the gold. Something inside him screams to 
him not to sign...
BUT HE SIGNS ALL THE SAME. He steps away.
ORLOK folds the papers and seals them with a series of 
medieval formalities in BLOOD RED WAX. The ORLOK SIGIL 
glistens in the candlelight. THOMAS feels his fate is somehow 
sealed within that sigil. He feels dirty. Guilty.
ORLOK
Now are we neighbours.
THOMAS
It is my good fortune, my lord. 
Forgive my asking, my lord, but why 
such an... antique residence as 
Grünewald Manor?
ORLOK breathes in the darkness.
ORLOK
The covenant is signed.
THOMAS
Of course...
THOMAS coughs again. He puts the papers into his satchel.
THOMAS
Well, I thank you and congratulate 
you on your new home.
ORLOK
It is late. You must wish to 
retire?
THOMAS
34.
If I may, my lord, if I may be 
slightly unsubtle in my approach... 
I wish to depart as soon as, well, 
as soon as agreeable, my services 
rendered. I am much... I have been 
enduring the most irregular dreams. 
I fear I am taken ill.
ORLOK has disappeared into darkness.
THOMAS
My lord? Count?
ORLOK’S voice is somehow louder and more overwhelming, even 
as he himself is unseen:
ORLOK (O.S.)
It is a black omen to journey in 
poor health. You will remain and 
well rest yourself, that your 
strength may soon return to you. 
Leave here your letters.
THOMAS
I must object, my lord.
ORLOK
You will obey this my council.
THOMAS
But my lord...
Silence.
THOMAS
Count?
THOMAS takes a step further... He runs into the darkness... 
ORLOK is nowhere to be found... THOMAS stops:
THOMAS
You have my locket...
He has never felt so vulnerable.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM – NIGHT

51
ELLEN stands by the window. She watches the ships pass in the 
harbour. Her white skin is even whiter in the moonlight.
35.
Slowly, a SHADOW drifts toward her, reaching... IT IS THE 
SHADOW OF ORLOK’S HAND... SHE HEARS THE FAMILIAR WHISPER OF 
HIS LANGUAGE... THE CLAW GRASPS HER TIGHT... ELLEN feels the 
shadow overwhelm her.
She is seized with terror. Her breath quickens... she is 
under his spell...
INT. CASTLE ORLOK - AFTERNOON
52
52
THOMAS tears through the castle.
Every door is locked. He has grown more pale... weak. Panic 
sets in.
EXT. CASTLE ORLOK. COURTYARD – LATE AFTERNOON
53
53
THOMAS runs to the main gate. It is locked too. He pulls, he 
bangs. It is no use. He knows for certain that he is a 
prisoner.
THOMAS scours the courtyard for a way out.
He finds another door. It is locked too, but very weather-
beaten. He can break in! THOMAS picks up a stone... HE 
smashes the door...
OMITTED
54
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. CRYPT - CONTINUOUS
55
55
THOMAS walks slowly... his eyes adjusting to the darkness...
He breathes heavily as he walks down a long, dank, dripping 
corridor.
In front of him is a steep stairwell... He descends... His 
heart racing... Breathing...
As he reaches the bottom of the staircase, he fumbles, not 
seeing the last step...
THOMAS looks: the castle catacombs. The rank smell of death 
is thick in the musty air. It stings his eyes.
He walks past coffins, skeletons in recessed tombs. At the 
far end of the vault is a large ANCIENT SARCOPHAGUS. He is 
drawn to it.
36.
He passes a few dim beams of SUNLIGHT. Near the coffin, a pit 
has been dug in the dirt floor – soil removed – a shovel 
stuck in the ground.
As he nears THE SARCOPHAGUS he sees it is adorned with a 
MAGICAL HEPTAGRAM. In the centre is Orlok’s SIGIL.
It compels him onward... Closer... closer...
He holds his breath... he pushes the lid open... it lands 
with a dusty thud.
WITHIN IS THE DEAD BODY OF ORLOK! In an instant Thomas sees: 
a horrible mangled creature, naked and half-buried in the 
rat-infested earth. His jaundiced, leathery flesh is bloated 
and bruised in the glands and stomach. Blood leaks from all 
of his orifices, especially his slightly open mouth, 
revealing sharp carnivorous teeth. His eyes wide open: dead, 
murky and colourless. He is a VAMPIRE.
THOMAS trembles, nearly falling backward. He picks up the 
nearby SHOVEL to strike him.
He bravely lifts it high... he thrusts it into the coffin...
(Behind him the dim beams 
of SUNLIGHT fade into 
darkness...)
ORLOK’S eyes grow conscious... Just then, ORLOK grabs the 
shovel... with incredible strength, he jerks it away from 
THOMAS... ORLOK rises from his coffin, the soil falling from 
his naked, emaciated body ... THOMAS runs!
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
56
56
THOMAS is in a trance, running, heavy breathing, the castle 
walls caving in on him. His heartbeat pounding his brains to 
bits.
BLACK WOLVES chase him like phantoms, growling and barking.
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER 57
57
57
THOMAS slams the door and locks it’s massive bolt. WOLVES 
jumping against the door! Their ferocity is relentless.
He cries and laughs in confusion, sinking to the floor.
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. DARKNESS - MOMENTS LATER
58
58
37.
ORLOK is still. He holds the LOCKET. He buries his face 
within his hands. He smells her HAIR. Deeply. His eyes fill 
with desire, rolling back in his head, becoming WHITE.
Slowly, he raises his hand as a great magician... his claw is 
tense with unimaginable power... he whispers a dark 
incantation to ELLEN.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – THE SAME TIME 59
59
59
ELLEN sleepwalks, hypnotized – her eyes wide.
She moves calmly and sylph-like, through the cold house 
wearing nothing but a thin nightgown. She is perspiring 
heavily. Her chest heaves.
Her mouth opens. She breathes sensually. Louder... Louder... 
She nears the stairs.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. BED CHAMBER – THE NEXT MOMENT 60
60
60
HARDING and ANNA are making love in bed. They kiss sweetly, 
lovingly. Quietly.
Suddenly... they hear FOOTSTEPS. Creaking floorboards.
ANNA
(whispered)
Stop.
HARDING doesn’t want to. He doesn’t.
ANNA
(whispered)
Stop my love. Do you hear that?
He stops. THE FOOTSTEPS GROW LOUDER. ANNA calls out:
ANNA
Clara? Is that you?
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. CORRIDOR - THE SAME MOMENT

ORLOK walks slowly, steadily, in darkness. Each un-dead step 
echoing through the castle...
Closer and closer to THOMAS...
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER CHAMBER - THE NEXT MOMENT 62
62
62
38.
THOMAS’ emotions fade. He is in a trance, eyes wide open like 
Ellen’s. He hears Orlok’s footsteps approaching...
THE SHADOW OF ORLOK looms over THOMAS trembling - but ORLOK 
is not in the room!
THOMAS steps away from the door... He stands back... The 
chamber door unlocks and slowly opens...
ORLOK stands in the distance surrounded by the WOLVES sitting 
tame at his feet. His eyes smoulder with bloodlust.
EXT. HARDING HOUSE – THE SAME TIME
63
63
ELLEN walks barefoot into the street... Her erotic breathing 
growing...
She nears the edge of the quay, dangerously close to a 
canal...
HARDING, ANNA and a SERVANT rush out after her!
HARDING & ANNA
Ellen! Ellen!

BREAST!
BLACK.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM – NIGHT
69
69
Several flickering lamps illuminate ELLEN’S room. A little 
porcelain-faced clock ticks balefully in the late hours of 
the night. A tall, kind-eyed gentleman, DOCTOR SIEVERS 
(40s/50s), is by ELLEN’S side packing up his bag. She moans a 
bit, asleep.
SIEVERS
In mild cases of somnambulism – 
sleepwalking – it is brought on by 
a congestion of the blood. Too much 
blood. Perhaps she was oppressed in 
a somewhat odd position beforehand.
HARDING
Yet she has had these fits in the 
past. Troubled nerves and so on.
SIEVERS
I see. If it continues, let me know 
of it, but for now, keep it from 
your worries, my dear fellow.
HARDING
Yes. Of course.
SIEVERS
40.
I am disposed to recommend that she 
sleep in her corset. It encourages 
the correct posture, calms the 
womb, and revives circulation.
HARDING
Yes, very well.
SIEVERS
And if her stirring escalates, you 
can always tie her to the bed.
SIEVERS tries to be humorous. HARDING laughs a little to be 
polite, though he finds the joke distasteful.
ELLEN starts to mumble. Yearning.
ELLEN
(whispered)
He is coming to me. He is coming.
HARDING looks concerned, uncomfortable, and somehow 
vulnerable from her overtly sexual tone. SIEVERS feels the 
same.
SIEVERS
I’ll increase the ether.
He douses a handkerchief in the sedative and covers her mouth 
and nose.
INT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER CHAMBER - DAWN
70
70
THOMAS awakes in pain. Very little blood left in his body – 
half dead.
He looks around. His shirt and waistcoat are bloody and have 
been torn open... He must escape!
Just then, he hears a terrible growling! He turns around... 
His door is open and THE WOLVES standing there – stalking 
him!
They dart into the chamber... THOMAS climbs on the window 
ledge... WOLVES jump at him... He flees out the window just 
in time!
EXT. CASTLE ORLOK. TOWER – MOMENTS LATER
71
71
THOMAS teeters outside the window. THE WOLVES bark, growl and 
snarl into the morning air.
41.
HE LOOKS DOWN: Through the mist, ICY WATER rushes through the 
remains of a moat out to a river. The mountain wind blows 
relentlessly... He can barely keep his balance on the 
ledge...
He has no choice... He closes his eyes... He leaps, 
disappearing into the mist... The water swallows him.
EXT. ESTUARY - SUNSET
72
72
ELLEN sits like a ghost wrapped in blankets in her wicker 
convalescent chair. She stares out at the sailing ships.
ELLEN
Nothing of Thomas – nothing?
HARDING AND ANNA, in furs, are by her. The children are not 
with them. Sea birds screech (O.S.).
HARDING
(overlapping)
No. I mean, yes. I have received 
nothing of any kind.
ELLEN
Not even to your... at the 
shipyard? And Herr Knock?
Ellen looks yearningly at Harding and grasps his hand. He 
pulls away reflexively, and averts his eyes from her gaze.
HARDING
Still no trace of him. The firm is 
in daily chaos.
HARDING looks at her now:
HARDING
I am most sensitive to your ardent 
nature, and shan’t reprove you 
further in this error of judgement. 
I will send someone daily until 
Herr Knock is found.
ELLEN looks out to the sea. HARDING feels a bit guilty.
HARDING
Thomas is well. I am certain of it.
ANNA
Leni, it is near sundown, we really 
ought to be leaving.
42.
ELLEN keeps staring out. Lost. Her eyes fill with tears.
ANNA
Leni?
ELLEN
A moment longer... please.
EXT. ESTUARY - LATER
73

HARDING AND ANNA walk away from ELLEN. THE SUN quickly 
disappears behind them. NIGHT approaches...
ANNA
Clara asked me today if Aunty Ellen 
has become a ghost.
HARDING
I thought it was agreed you were to 
keep the girls from her.
ANNA
Friedrich, be not a churl, please –
HARDING
You mustn’t be swept up in her 
fairy ways. The entirety of the 
household centres upon her whims. I 
tire of discussing her.
ANNA
Think you there is no burden upon 
myself? I love her. She is 
blameless of her malady.
HARDING
Forgive me, my love. Dr. Sievers 
will pay another visit. Let us only 
please talk of something else. How 
is our little Friedrich?
He touches her belly. She smiles a bit.
ANNA
Well. Hungry as always ...
(she smiles)
Like his father.
HARDING leans in and kisses her. ANNA blushes.
ANNA
Really, Friedrich, in public.
43.
HARDING
I cannot resist you, my love.
ANNA smiles, and then looks over her shoulder... She screams:
ANNA
Ellen! Leni!!
The SUN has set. The tide has risen. ELLEN has fallen, 
covered in slime and muck. Her skirts are up around her 
waist. One legs is bare, the other in just a stocking... her 
thighs exposed... her satin shoes lost in the bay. Her body 
convulsing erotically...
ELLEN
He is coming! He is coming!
INT. WISBURG HOSPITAL. SURGERY – DAY
74
74
A hostile scream is heard in the distance.
SIEVERS
A new patient?
SIEVERS turns from his fastidiously-ordered desk. His chair 
creaks. A uniformed ORDERLY (50s) mops the sweat from his 
brow. The screaming continues echoing in the halls.
ORDERLY
Yes sir, he’s... we stowed ‘em 
downstairs, sir.
SIEVERS
(overlapping)
I have strictly forbidden the use 
of the old cells!
ORDERLY
Beggin’ your pardon, Doctor, sir –
SIEVERS
Out of the question. This a modern 
hospital, not a prison –
THE ORDERLY continues. He is in a mild state of shock.
ORDERLY
A little old soul he looks, but on 
my life... saw him screamin’ and a-
groanin’... found him at the Luther 
Christmas market... killed three 
sheep with his bare hands – and he 
was eatin’ em raw-like. Raw!
44.
INT. WISBURG HOSPITAL. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
75
75
SIEVERS walks THE ORDERLY to the old 18th century cells. The 
ones they don’t like to talk about. An eerie weeping is heard 
from inside...
THE ORDERLY opens a wooden door, nearly one foot thick... 
They enter...
INT. WISBURG HOSPITAL. KNOCK’S CELL - CONTINUOUS 76
76
76
It is dark. In the far corner of the cold, damp room is a 
HUNCHED FIGURE rocking back and forth, weeping. A murky shaft 
of light leaks through the small, barred window. The same 
“mysterious symbols” are scratched into the plaster walls.
SIEVERS slowly approaches. THE ORDERLY stands close by.
SIEVERS
Hello. Good day, mein Herr. I am 
Dr. Sievers.
THE FIGURE keeps weeping. PIGEONS dart about.
SIEVERS
What, what seems to be the trouble?
KNOCK
No trouble. Providence. Providence. 
He is coming to us.
His weeping turns into a laugh... a familiar laugh.
SIEVERS
I see. Can you tell me your name, 
Herr...?
KNOCK
(overlapping)
No one. I am no one. His servant.
SIEVERS
And um, what do you have there?
The laughter continues. He turns around... It is KNOCK, dried 
blood upon his chin and expensive shirt front. His eyes are 
pitiful. Somehow missing the spark of human-ness. By his side 
is a collection of dead cockroaches, spiders, birds, etc.
KNOCK
Lives. Gifts bestowed from his 
Lordship.
(laughs)
45.
He eats one of the spiders. He laughs.
Suddenly, KNOCK scuttles along the straw-strewn floor and 
catches one of the waddling PIGEONS. He pets it.
KNOCK
She is a pretty one.
(jealous)
His Lordship loves the pretty ones 
best.
KNOCK presses the PIGEON against his face.
SIEVERS
His Lordship?
KNOCK becomes very excited.
KNOCK
He is Infinity... Eyes shining like 
a jewelled diadem. Putrescence. 
Asphyxience.
KNOCK PUTS THE PIGEON’S HEAD IN HIS MOUTH... HE BITES THE
HEAD OFF THE PIGEON! He swallows it!
KNOCK
Devourence.
SIEVERS stays calm.
SIEVERS
Now, my good fellow, why would you 
do that?
SIEVERS walks toward him. THE ORDERLY follows with his club 
ready.
KNOCK flinches, afraid.
SIEVERS
(to The Orderly)
It’s alright.
(To Knock)
No one wants to hurt you, my dear 
friend.
SIEVERS walks closer.
KNOCK
He is coming.
Closer...
46.
SIEVERS
Who, who is?
KNOCK
‘Twas He that invoked me! ’Twas I 
that was chosen to serve Him for I 
know what He covets. And He shall 
cast upon you curses, confusion, 
affliction and rebuke, for you have 
forsaken me! And He shall reign 
over all your empty corpses! 
Devourence! Devourence!!
KNOCK ATTACKS SIEVERS! THE ORDERLY blows his whistle and 
pulls them apart. TWO MORE ATTENDANTS rush in, throwing pails 
of water on KNOCK and beat him with their clubs. He laughs 
and laughs, struggling, and bleeding on the floor. He seems 
to enjoy the beating.
KNOCK
He is coming!
Whack! Whack!! WHACK!!!
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM – NIGHT
77
77
ELLEN, her eyes wide, tosses and turns violently in bed.
ELLEN
(whispered)
He is coming.
DR. SIEVERS tightens the laces of her corset as HARDING holds 
her down. They can barely contain her. ANNA stands by in 
distress. HARDING and ANNA exchange a tense glance as ELLEN 
moans, restrained by the men.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. REAR DRAWING ROOM – NIGHT
78
78
HARDING is crouched by his billiard table. He listlessly 
rolls the balls around, distracted. Tired. Very tired.
HARDING
These hysterical spells come over 
her at nightfall, like clockwork. 
Cigar?
He lights one to ease his stress.
SIEVERS
(declining the offer)
Thank you.
47.
SIEVERS takes a pinch of snuff. His eyes teem with concern.
SIEVERS
I... I lament to tell you this... 
Hutter’s employer, Herr Knock, 
he... he was admitted to the 
hospital this morning.
HARDING looks up quickly.
HARDING
What? Did you speak to him of 
Thomas?
SIEVERS
He’s mad.
HARDING
Mad?
SIEVERS
Non compos mentis. And Friedrich, 
he... well, the wretched fellow – 
while inflamed with some sort of 
religious mania – he shares a 
similar motto to Frau Hutter: “He 
is coming.”
HARDING
What?
SIEVERS
Which brings me to the specialist –
HARDING
(to himself)
Where the devil are you, Thomas!?
EXT. BUKOVINA RIVER BANK - DUSK
79

THOMAS is alive - barely. His body is washed up on shore in a 
twisted heap.
An young Orthodox nun, a NOVICE, is collecting firewood, and 
has a large bundle of branches on her back. She takes a step. 
She gasps as she sees THOMAS.
INT. ORTHODOX MONASTERY - NIGHT
80
80
THOMAS’ limp body is carried by dozens of ORTHODOX NUNS in 
their strange black habits. He shivers uncontrollably.
48.
Women’s hands of all ages pass over his body. They walk him 
through monastery, every inch covered in frescos of saints, 
illuminated by hundreds of candles. The NUNS pray and pray. 
He breathes heavily, pained.
THEY SEE HIS VAMPIRE BITE. Their praying grows louder.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. REAR DRAWING ROOM – NIGHT
81

SIEVERS
A man by the name of Franz. Swiss.
HARDING
(slightly horrified)
Swiss?
SIEVERS
Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz. 
He is the sole person who might be 
able to diagnose her. An eminent 
physician and scholar in Zürich, 
when I was at school. My finest 
teacher.
HARDING
Send a message to Zürich then.
SIEVERS
No. He is here. In Wisburg.
HARDING
Here? Here? Why haven’t you told 
me, man?
SIEVERS
Well, you see, he... von Franz is 
the most learned in the field... 
his mind... staggering–
HARDING
I’ll spare no expense.
SIEVERS
No, you misunderstand me, 
Friedrich. It falls hard on me to 
recommend him... He was tossed out 
of the university – laughed out of 
his home country.
HARDING
What?
SIEVERS
49.
It grieves me to speak it, but he 
became obsessed with the work of 
Paracelsus, Agrippa, and the like.
HARDING
I’m a ship-man, Sievers.
SIEVERS
Alchemy, mystic philosophy... the 
occult.
This chills HARDING.
INT. ORTHODOX MONASTERY - CHAPEL - LATER

THOMAS lies on a table, shirtless and profusely sweating. He 
trembles in agony. NUNS pray. An aged PRIEST incants prayers 
and douses him with HOLY WATER.
- LATER
82A
82A
THOMAS has an icon placed on his chest. NUNS pray around him, 
with a tiny SCHEMA ABBESS(90s) clutching a cross in her 
wrinkled fist.
The PRIEST continues exorcizing the sickness away. He presses 
her hands firmly on his head: in Old Church Slavonic he prays 
with the might of Christ resurrecting Lazarus...
Suddenly, THOMAS inhales... his eyes open wide:
THOMAS
No! Orlok! No!!
He rises from the bed, drenched in sweat, icon slipping. At 
the name “Orlok,” the ABBESS is seized with terror.
MONASTERY CELL - LATER
82B
82B
THOMAS is swaddled in blankets, listening intently, still 
shaking. THE OLD SCHEMA ABBESS speaks to him in Romanian. A 
young NOVICE translates for her:
NOVICE
A black enchanter he was in life. 
Şolomanari. The Devil preserved his 
soul that his corpse may walk again 
in blaspheme.
THE ABBESS continues, she gesticulates with fervour.
50.
NOVICE
You are lost in his shadow.
THOMAS breaks down into tears. He shouts with determination:
THOMAS
No!
NOVICE
Enchanters turn their spirit into 
shadow to infect your dreams.
THOMAS
I must leave! I... I promised 
Ellen.
NOVICE
Remain here. His evil cannot enter 
this house of God.
THOMAS
I promised I’d join the firm... I 
came here to sell the count a home 
in Wisburg.
NOVICE
Rest! Become well!
THOMAS
He is bound for Wisburg!
NOVICE
He cannot leave – he must return to 
the cursèd earth wherein he was 
buried.
THOMAS
No! He seeks after Ellen. I know 
it!

INT. HOSPITAL. KNOCK’S CELL – DAY
85
85
KNOCK’S hair has been crudely shorn. He is strapped into a 
chair that looks like a torture device. His trousers are 
removed. There is a chamber pot attached to the bottom of the 
seat. His head is held up vertically with a metal vice. He 
laughs. With every laugh he is caused great pain by the vice.
KNOCK
Your Lordship cometh! Sew thy 
pestilence within them, reap their 
blood, yet spare me! Bestow thy 
secret art upon me, and I shall 
serve by thy side! I have not 
failed your Lordship... thy 
promised gift awaits!
He shakes. The straps and buckles pressing into his flesh – 
the metal vice fighting against his every movement.
KNOCK
Providence!

ELLEN stands in the dark. She hears ORLOK’S whisper.

SIEVERS and HARDING walk in the frosty night. Dogs barking. 
Vagrants. Garbage.
SIEVERS
The scientific community is on a 
crusade to prove his work drove him 
to madness.
HARDING
I am responsible for Thomas’s wife–
HARDING bumps into a DRUNKARD urinating in the street, who 
curses him:
DRUNKARD
Bleedin’ dandy bum-boy!
SIEVERS
But it’s a sham. A sham. I assure 
you, Harding, he may be a bit... 
unconventional, but he will know 
the cause.

INT. BOARDING HOUSE HALLWAY – NIGHT
91
91
They stand cramped in front of an attic DOOR. SIEVERS knocks 
with his walking stick.
SIEVERS
Professor von Franz?
No response. Sooty sconces drip wax down the buckling wall. 
HARDING looks all the more unsure.
SIEVERS knocks again. A weak, aged voice answers:
VON FRANZ (O.S.)
Leave me be.
53.
SIEVERS
It is your former student–
The voice booms:
VON FRANZ (O.S.)
Avaunt! Be gone I say!
SIEVERS tries the handle. It’s unlocked. He opens it...
INT. VON FRANZ’S ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
92
92
SIEVERS
Please, Professor...
HARDING AND SIEVERS are aghast. VON FRANZ’S attic flat is an 
absolute catastrophe. Piles of books everywhere – some 
holding up broken chairs, cabinets of occult curiosities, 
esoteric charts, and every surface is covered in old china, 
crumbs, and dust. Dust, dust, and more dust. Several STRAY 
CATS prowl about, lapping up remnants from the china.
A muttering is heard... it is VON FRANZ. He sits smoking his 
pipe. Several giant books on his lap. He wears an oriental 
robe and slippers. His disheveled hair is long. His white 
moustaches are upturned – yellowed from his incessant 
smoking. He holds his large SIGNET RING like an amulet. He 
seems hypnotised, or mad. Or maybe just very old.
VON FRANZ
(to himself)
I had nearly unlocked the final key 
of the Mysteriorum Libri Quinque.
SIEVERS
I am sorry Professor, I...
VON FRANZ
No... No matter. I miscalculated 
the stars. Hermes will not render 
my black sulfur gold this evening.
He crosses himself and continues mumbling, rubbing his ring.
HARDING is uncomfortable, he clearly thinks the old man is 
mad.
HARDING
Yes, we shan’t trouble you further, 
we must take our leave.
SIEVERS walks toward VON FRANZ.
54.
SIEVERS
Good night, Professor.
SIEVERS puts his hand on VON FRANZ’s hand.
SIEVERS
Nolite dare sanctum canibus.
(Subtitle: Do not reveal 
what is sacred to dogs)
Something clicks. VON FRANZ hears the doctor’s words.
He holds up his quizzing-glass and sees SIEVERS through the 
lens. His eyes sparkle in the candlelight – nearly as intense 
as Orlok’s. He laughs heartily. He has come alive!
VON FRANZ (O.S.)
Neque mittatis margaritas vestra 
ante porcos!
(Subtitle: Nor cast your 
pearls before swine)
My dear young Sievers, or do my 
dying eyes deceive me? I should 
have known!
VON FRANZ stands, laughing, his books falling to the floor.
VON FRANZ
Embrace me, my boy! I am so 
rejoiced to see you.
As they hug, clouds of dust fly off of VON FRANZ’S clothing.
VON FRANZ
I sensed something... It took me to 
Wisburg all these years ago, and I 
had felt that now it was imminently 
approaching. I thought it ill,
(laughs)
but it must have been you!
(laughs)
Now, what is the matter?
He looks at HARDING’S bewildered face.
VON FRANZ
Ah, I see, yes. Your friend’s dear 
wife: a morbid melancholic 
exhibiting acute hysteria 
manifested in protracted fits of 
somnambulism.
SIEVERS is triumphant. HARDING is in disbelief.
55.
VON FRANZ
You look tired, young man.
VON FRANZ dumps out a few china cups into a basin. He pulls 
out a bottle:
VON FRANZ
Schnapps?

THOMAS gallops away on a HORSE. He wears a borrowed shearling 
coat and looks like a shell of his former self. But his eyes

THE OLD ABBESS runs out of THE MONASTERY, several nuns behind 
her.
THOMAS rides off into the snowy dawn.

Several DECK HANDS are searching the dark hold for something.
A rugged CAPTAIN descends from the hatch.
CAPTAIN YUSOV
(Russian, Subtitled)
Back to the quarterdeck with you!
FIRST MATE
(Russian, Subtitled)
But Vasilyev’s still missing. And 
now Redenko.
Suddenly they hear a THUD – they dash toward the sound:
A burly SAILOR is convulsing on the floor of the hold, 
entwined in rope. He has SMALL RED WOUNDS ALL OVER HIS FLESH. 
He coughs, vomiting up BLOOD AND BILE – extreme 
haemorrhaging.
THE CABIN BOY is DEAD by his side. The DECK HANDS back away 
from the sight as several RATS scuttle from the bodies. The 
sailor screams, choking on his blood.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM – DAY

HARDING and ANNA escort SIEVERS and VON FRANZ to Ellen’s 
room. Von Franz is shocked.
56.
VON FRANZ
Untie this child at once!
ELLEN IS TIED DOWN TO THE BED. She is pale, damp, exhausted. 
Her eyes are red. Her bedclothes saturated with perspiration.
The chamber has been turned to a sickroom, all the luxuries 
gone. Only a bed, a chair, a chamber pot and pail, and a few 
PLANTS in the window remain. GRETA, the cat, however, is with 
her
HARDING
It is all I could do to keep her 
from tearing the room to ribbons. 
She -
VON FRANZ
Untie her!
SIEVERS unties her with VON FRANZ. HARDING assists, in shame.
ELLEN sees VON FRANZ and looks at him with hope. She smiles, 
but her voice is very strained.
ELLEN
You are the doctor our Sievers 
spoke of?
VON FRANZ
(to Sievers)
Drugged?
SIEVERS
I have been administering an 
opiate. She must rest by day, for 
her body is in utter stress all the 
night.
VON FRANZ
(overlapping)
She cannot be clouded. Step away. 
Step away!
VON FRANZ sits beside the bed.
VON FRANZ
(to Ellen)
My dear creature, yes, I am he, and 
I am hither come to help you.
ELLEN, now unrestrained, holds GRETA tight.
VON FRANZ
Is she yours?
57.
ELLEN
Greta?
(laughs)
She has no master nor mistress.
VON FRANZ
(laughs)
Quite so.
He pets GRETA, and takes something from his pocket to feed 
her.
VON FRANZ looks at ELLEN in the eye.
VON FRANZ
I entreat you to excuse me, but I 
should like to begin my 
consultation presently. You see, I 
have a curiosity about you – Dr. 
Sievers tells me you have had these 
spells since childhood?
ELLEN nods yes.
VON FRANZ
Would you describe them to me?
ELLEN
I cannot always remember them. As 
if my spirit wanders off.
VON FRANZ
Tell me what you can. From the 
beginning.
While her voice is weak, she speaks with ease, without shame.
ELLEN
Sometimes it was... it is like a 
dream. And I know things. I always 
knew the contents of my Christmas 
gifts. I knew when... that my 
mother would pass. Father... he 
would find me in our fields... 
within the forest... as if – I was 
his little changeling girl.
VON FRANZ
I see.
ELLEN grows uneasy.
ELLEN
58.
But as I became older it 
worsened... Father dispraised me 
for it... I frightened him. My 
touch. I was so very alone, you see 
and... I wished for comfort... then 
a presence... and the nightmares, 
the epilepsies... I...
VON FRANZ
Pray, continue.
ELLEN sees the story vividly. Reexperiencing the emotions.
ELLEN
At last Papa found me once 
laying... unclothed, I was... my 
body... my flesh... my...
Intense sexual implications are clear in her tone. Everyone 
is embarrassed, except for VON FRANZ.
ELLEN
Sin, sin, he said... He would have 
sent me to someplace... I shan’t 
go... I –
VON FRANZ
No, no.
ELLEN
It all ended when first I met my 
Thomas.
VON FRANZ
Your husband?
ELLEN
From our love, I became as normal.
VON FRANZ
Yet these visions and night 
wanderings have returned to you?
ELLEN
He left on a fool’s errand. I fear 
for him so.
ELLEN leans closer to VON FRANZ with intensity.
ELLEN
Professor... My dreams grow darker, 
they sicken me. Does evil come from 
within us or from beyond?

A violent gale has begun. Freezing rain. Sleet.
A corpse in a canvas body bag is dropped into the sea. Waves

THE FIRST MATE, CAPTAIN YUSOV, and DECK HAND 2 stand by, 
shivering in their icy oilskins. They cross themselves.
THE FIRST MATE fills with rage. He whispers to himself:

He looks out at the hellish moonrise and lifts a boarding AXE 
with determination!

The room is now quite dark.
VON FRANZ
Her trance state is begun.
It has. A quick breath parts her lips. VON FRANZ presses on 
her body very hard... Her wrists, her neck...
VON FRANZ
You have bled her to decrease the 
congestion.
SIEVERS
Of course.
He lifts up her chemise and presses on her womb...
VON FRANZ
And her menstruations are also?
SIEVERS
Liberal.
ELLEN’S breathing increases...
VON FRANZ
Too much blood. Too much.
(to Sievers)
A taper, please.
SIEVERS lights a candle.
60.
VON FRANZ holds it near ELLEN’S eyes, peering through his 
quizzing-glass.
VON FRANZ
The pupil is expanded. It does not 
contract naturally to light.
SIEVERS
Impossible.
VON FRANZ
A second sight. She is no longer 
here. My bag...
VON FRANZ takes out a long needle.
VON FRANZ
Forgive the grotesque tediousness 
of this demonstration, however, I 
must impress upon you that this 
child is not with us.
VON FRANZ draws the needle through the flame, then inserts it 
into Ellen’s delicate wrist – through her flesh and out the 
other side. Ellen does not react at all.
VON FRANZ
Restrain your protestations, for 
she feels nothing. She communes now 
with another realm.
He removes the needle.
VON FRANZ
Sievers, bind the wound.
VON FRANZ places his palm on ELLEN’S FOREHEAD.
VON FRANZ
(to Ellen)
Now, do you hear me my child?
She shakes her head “yes.”
VON FRANZ
What then do you see?
ELLEN
I... I...
VON FRANZ
I charge you, speak now what you 
see.
61.
ELLEN
Enduring night... a spectre of 
death... He... he... spreads his 
shadow... and... and... he is 
coming–
VON FRANZ
Who, who is coming to you my child?
ELLEN
...
VON FRANZ
Who?!
Her muscles tense... Her breathing becomes rapid.
VON FRANZ removes his ring and places it on her forehead. He 
holds it there and presses on it.
VON FRANZ
Who, damn you!? Speak!!
ANNA
(overlapping)
Please, Professor!
VON FRANZ
I will not harm her!
HER FIT BUILDS. HER BODY CONTORTS... HER VOICE STIFLED... VON

FRANZ presses harder on the ring.
VON FRANZ
I command you, hearken to my voice. 
By the protection of Chamuel, 
Haniel, and Zadkiel, impart your 
speech unto me. In the name of 
Eligos, Orabas, and Asmoday, impart 
your speech unto me!
She speaks as if her voice were trying to free itself from 
hell:
ELLEN
I shall persist to join you every 
night, first in sleep, then in your 
arms. Everything will be mixed with 
abomination, and you'll be knee-
deep in blood. Everyone will cry. 
There will be none to bury the 
dead.
62.
VON FRANZ grabs her shoulders... Her fit worsens...
ELLEN
You... are... promised... to... me.
VON FRANZ
Promised? Promised?!
ANNA
(overlapping)
She means her husband!
ELLEN TRIES TO BREAK FROM HER FIT, SCREAMING:
ELLEN
Help me! Help me!
She holds VON FRANZ’S lapels, tight... She clenches her fists 
harder... harder... tearing the buttons off of his jacket... 
SCREAMING...
ELLEN
HELP ME!!!!

VON FRANZ indiscreetly lights his pipe on one of the many

Everyone else stands or sits, horrified from the last scene.
ELLEN’S screaming is heard from upstairs.
VON FRANZ
As I feared.
Long pause.
HARDING
Well?
VON FRANZ
Well what, my boy? Cannot you see?
HARDING
See what?
VON FRANZ
See that she is cursed.
HARDING
Cursed?
63.
VON FRANZ
Yes, cursed. The dear young 
creature is obsessed of some spirit 
... perhaps some daemon.
HARDING
I beg your pardon?
SIEVERS
I assure you, Harding, the good 
professor means this as hyperbole.
VON FRANZ
No, I mean a daemon.
HARDING
You jest–
SIEVERS
What of your discovery of macabre 
hallucination pathologies –
VON FRANZ
This is not one!
HARDING
You scarcely looked at her!
ANNA
How should this happen to Ellen?
VON FRANZ
Daemonic spirits more easily obsess 
those whose lower animal functions 
dominate - Daemons like them, they 
seek them out.
ANNA
How mean you?
VON FRANZ
They can discover their victims 
from across mountains, great 
oceans...
SIEVERS
Those with lower animal funct- ?
VON FRANZ
Yes. Hysterics, children, 
lunatics... which reminds me - 
Sievers, you must introduce me to 
your mad man tomorrow.

Yes of course, but Professor I -
VON FRANZ
Somnambulists afflicted with these 
perversions oft possess a gift: a 
second sight into the borderland.
SIEVERS
I do not wish to dispute you, yet, 
I have myself seen women of nervous 
constitutions invent any manor of 
delusion.
VON FRANZ
This is no delusion. I believe she 
has always been highly conductive 
to these cosmic forces, uniquely 
so. The lunatic... perhaps.
This terrifies HARDING.
SIEVERS
Do you then acknowledge a 
connection between these cases?
VON FRANZ
That is the question.
VON FRANZ
No. This evil, what it is, how it 
has been summoned – unleashed – I 
know not. But this remarkable child 
it has chained itself to is in 
grave peril.
VON FRANZ puts on his coat to leave.
VON FRANZ
I must to my studies. Frau Harding, 
sit with her, observe her, report 
her behaviour. Sievers, no more 
ether.
SIEVERS
She will rave all the night.
VON FRANZ
Then rave she must! There is a 
dread storm rising!

THE FIRST MATE descends down into the dark hold...
Rain and sleet pour in through the open hatch above ...
THE FIRST MATE’S breathing grows louder... It grows darker 
with every step down the ladder ... Darker...
It is very hard to see. Water drips. The ship rocks, the 
timbers creak. He breathes, afraid, but fierce. His breath 
turns to steam in the lamp light. He holds his AXE firm...
He slowly approaches THE CRATE... Rats scurry... his single 
sailor’s earring shakes with fear.
He walks closer... Closer... Breathing... Breathing...
He hacks at it! The wood splinters... RATS spew out of the 
crate... THE FIRST MATE doesn’t see, but in the shadows 
behind him, A TALL, THIN FIGURE APPROACHES...
He hacks at the crate again! THE FIGURE comes closer... THE 
FIRST MATE has torn a large hole in the crate....
He gasps to discover that INSIDE IS A COFFIN... THE FIGURE is 
even closer...
THE FIRST MATE leans forward toward the sarcophagus, and 
wedges it open with his axe... He reaches his hand inside...
Only soil. He frantically searches for something... but 
nothing is there! He turns around in defeat...
SUDDENLY, ORLOK STANDS BEFORE HIM, A NAKED, ROTTEN CORPSE! HE 
TAKES THE FIRST MATE IN HIS ENORMOUS CLAWS, AND SINKS HIS 
TEETH INTO HIS BREAST! THE FIRST MATE TRIES TO SCREAM... 
ORLOK WRAPS AROUND HIM, SMOTHERING HIM, SUFFOCATING HIM... HE 
STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE, BUT ORLOK DRAGS HIM INTO SHADOW!!

ELLEN
Anna please... Please...
Conflicted, ANNA lets her go.

ELLEN rises slowly, drenched in sweat...
She goes to the window, her desire is intense, but she stands 
utterly still, looking out.
ANNA follows with trepidation...
THEY STAND next to each other. They watch THE STORM RAGE. 
ELLEN breathes with want, fogging the warped glass of the 
window.

WISBURG, silhouetted by the moon, lays asleep. The whole city 
is shut in from the storm. ORLOK’S MAGICAL INCANTATIONS ECHO 
IN THE WIND.
THE EMPUSA is hurled along by the tempest toward the town. 
Sails billow like ghosts’ funeral shrouds. A terrible crash 
is imminent...

KNOCK laughs in his restraints. Rain and sleet in his cell. 
He rocks back and forth.
KNOCK
His Lordship! He is come!
His screaming becomes so horrific, the NIGHT ORDERLY runs 
into the cell. KNOCK is completely crazed, he begins 
seizing... thick spittle and blood ooze from his clenched 
teeth.
In a panic, THE ORDERLY blows his whistle, rapidly unbuckling 
KNOCK’S bonds... Just as he lets loose of the final strap, 
KNOCK’S eyes change... his convulsing stops. It was all an 
act...
HE ATTACKS THE ORDERLY LIKE AN ANIMAL, BITING INTO HIS
THROAT, BLOOD SPURTING ACROSS THE ROOM! He falls dead to the 
floor. KNOCK laps up the blood.
KNOCK
The blood is the life!

ELLEN bursts outside into the street, the icy rain still 
descending.
THOMAS RIDES A HORSE THROUGH THE STORM! HE IS HERE! He is 
nearly horizontal. He tumbles off the saddle, dressed in 
strange eastern garb. He looks like hell.
THOMAS
Ellen!
ELLEN picks him up off the street. She holds his head and 
kisses him all over his face. The horse continues to rear, 
frantically whinnying.

THOMAS AND ELLEN sit on the divan, wet and shivering. He

He hasn’t found you. I... I feared

He coughs repeatedly. ELLEN holds him – she seems herself 
again.
ELLEN
My love.
THOMAS crumbles in her arms, delirious...
THOMAS

You were right. You were... It...

HARDING
What the hell is it now? Hartmann,

SERVANT (O.S.)
Very good, sir.

A long SKIFF drifts across black nighttime waters toward the

KNOCK is within the boat, escorting Orlok’s COFFIN.

THOMAS lies in pain in Ellen’s sickbed. She holds his face

He twists in agony as if having a terrible nightmare.

CLOSE ON: ORLOK’S EYES. HE feels Thomas’ presence.
ORLOK
The broker lives. I had cast aside 
his carrion body for my hellhounds 
to feed on.
WIDE: KNOCK kneels before ORLOK on the floor of the entirely 
dilapidated and abandoned room (ORLOK is unseen).
KNOCK
I shall then stifle out the 
bridegroom, your Lordship.
ORLOK (O.S.)
I have use in him.
CLOSE ON: KNOCK (ORLOK remains unseen).
KNOCK
Pray then, instruct me, my Lord. 
Charge me. Use me. Shall I fetch 
unto thee thy pretty belonging?

ORLOK (O.S.)
The compact commands she must 
willingly re-pledge her vow. She 
cannot be stolen.
KNOCK rises to touch the hem of Orlok’s coat.
KNOCK
Yet my Lord, I beg thee.
ORLOK (O.S.)
Silence, dog!
ORLOK roars (still O.S.), striking KNOCK from within the 
darkness. KNOCK falls, smashing his face to the floor.
ORLOK
Your entreaties grow insolent. You 
shall crave of me nothing.
KNOCK nurses his bloody nose, barely able to speak.
KNOCK
My Lord.
ORLOK (O.S.)
Away!
CLOSE ON: ORLOK profile.
ORLOK
Daybreak draws near. Anon the bells

ELLEN
I fear no better than everyone 
tells me I have suffered. Pray, 
forgive me for the troubles I have 
caused you.
ANNA
I am only glad that you have become 
yourself again. It seems a miracle. 
Perhaps Professor Franz was wrong. 
Perhaps it was only your wish to 
see Thomas safely returned, and 
your... your -
ELLEN
My melancholy?
Pause.
ELLEN
Thomas has seen something awful. If 
only I could speak to the professor 
–
ANNA
Hush. His thoughts are so queer, so 
sordid, I dare not repeat them.
ELLEN
Professor Franz said a demon!
ANNA
Leni, please. For the sake of the 
children – Christmastide is upon 
us. Why must you remain so 
exasperatingly contrary?!
ELLEN
Because I am in the right!
INT. WISBURG HOSPITAL. MORGUE - AFTERNOON
115
115
SIEVERS uncovers the corpse of CAPTAIN YUSOV on a wooden 
slab. The air is thick with the stench of dripping carbolic 
acid. An ATTENDANT assists Sievers.
VON FRANZ
Sievers, I requested conference 
with your maniac, not a dead man.
SIEVERS
72.
I beg your patience, Professor. 
This is what vexes me: He exhibits 
all the signs of a blood plague: 
sepsis, ophthalmic discharge – even 
flagrant rodent bites, here and 
here. I fear this ship has brought 
the plague to Wisburg.
VON FRANZ crosses himself.
SIEVERS
What’s more, his body is entirely 
absent of blood.
SIEVERS
And look at this curious mark 
here...
VON FRANZ looks at the chest. A VAMPIRE BITE.
SIEVERS
I have seen some leviathan-like 
pests in our canals, but tell me, 
Professor, what rat has jaws of 
such size?
VON FRANZ is stunned.
VON FRANZ
(to himself)
Angels and Daemons protect us.
(to Sievers)
Where is your lunatic? You must 
take me to him presently!
ATTENDANT
Ain’t you heard it, Doctor, sir?
SIEVERS
No...
ATTENDANT
Herr Knock, he’s gone and escaped –
VON FRANZ
That man must be found!
He puts on his hat and heads to the door in haste.
VON FRANZ
Sirrah, show me out. Sievers, meet 
me at my residence tonight. I must 
to my studies!

INT. VON FRANZ’S ATTIC - NIGHT
116

HARDING and SIEVERS stand awkwardly, leaning forward in 
unison, peering into a MAGNIFYING GLASS on a stand.
VON FRANZ
Gnathobdela. The common leech.
IN THE GLASS: A LEECH on VON FRANZ’s hand, sucking his blood.
It twitches vulgarly. VON FRANZ’S vein pulses.
VON FRANZ
Its sole impulse is to feed on what 
even Mephistopheles calls “the most 
especial nectar.” Look at her 
drink.
(laughs)
HARDING
Please Professor, what is all this?
VON FRANZ
Quickly now, Sievers ...
VON FRANZ removes THE LEECH with some tweezers and sucks his 
wound. He spits on the floor and puts the leech in a jar.
VON FRANZ
... the plague is present in its 
most rapidly fatal form, Pestis 
siderans.
SIEVERS
(to Harding)
A savage infection of the blood.
VON FRANZ
(to Sievers)
You have read Glaser’s treatise on 
the pestilent revenants of the 
eastern frontiers of the Hapsburg 
Empire?
SIEVERS is completely shocked.
SIEVERS
That has been long proven to be a 
degrading peasant superstition.
VON FRANZ
Is our leech a superstition?
SIEVERS laughs.
74.
SIEVERS
No, but leeches do not rise from 
the grave, my dear professor.
VON FRANZ
Please, Sievers, please, explain 
Glaser’s account.
SIEVERS begins, reluctantly.
SIEVERS
A... a plague ravaged the 
countryside. The alleged cause ... 
a... a walking corpse that 
maintained a semblance of life by 
feeding on the heart blood of the 
living. Every victim succumbed to 
death.

ORLOK stands in a huge, dark, furniture-less room. His stance

He begins his incantations... He raises his hand... he opens 
his palms...

ELLEN AND THOMAS lie in bed together. She holds him close.
ORLOK (V.O.)

Your bond shall not survive me.
ORLOK’S SHADOW SPREADS OVER THOMAS. ELLEN doesn’t see it.
THOMAS struggles in bed. ELLEN touches him gently...
IMAGE: ORLOK attacks THOMAS!
THOMAS wakes from his nightmare vision... he pulls away from 
ELLEN. In his delirium, he barks at her fiercely:
THOMAS
Get off me. Give me room. I can’t 
breathe!
She is stunned. She tries to comfort him:
ELLEN
75.
It’s me.
THOMAS
I can’t breathe... Get off!!!
He throws her off of him violently, accidentally striking 
her... SHE NEARLY FALLS OFF THE BED...
HOLD ON: ELLEN’S face, afraid, and hurt. She doesn’t want to 
feel rejected, BUT SHE DOES.

I promise, I shan’t let anything 
harm you. No monsters – nothing. 
Now, kiss me good night and say 
your prayers.
ANNA kisses them. She hesitates, then closes the door.
CLARA (O.S.)
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray 
the Lord my soul to keep...
ANNA walks with her LAMP...
She sees something move in the shadows. Her blood runs cold. 
She hears footsteps. She is gripped with fear.
Suddenly, something emerges from the dark...
She gasps, almost dropping the lamp.
She looks: it’s only ELLEN.
ANNA
You frightened me.
ELLEN
Forgive me.
ELLEN is beginning to look haunted again.
ELLEN
Has Friedrich returned?

No.
ANNA senses ELLEN’S sadness.

ELLEN looks at her longingly...

ELLEN cuddles in with ANNA in bed, playing with THE CROSS 
around ANNA’S neck like a kitten. ANNA’S eyes droop.
ANNA
If I speak yet more words of 
comfort, you must not hear them as 
feeble or petty. Our friendship is 
a precious balm to my heart. 
Forgive my chiding you.
ELLEN
Thank you for loving me.
ANNA is not quite sure what to say.
ANNA
You may take it if you wish.
ELLEN takes THE CROSS off of her and plays with it.
ANNA
God is with us, Leni.
ELLEN whispers to her:
ELLEN
Don’t close your eyes first. 
Please.
ANNA
I shan’t.
ELLEN
Let me watch you.

ELLEN watches her, yearning. She holds THE CROSS.

HARDING is standing by the stove, still exasperated.
HARDING
I cannot yield to being haunted by 
some ghost!
VON FRANZ
No, no, no, please, no. It is no 
mere ghost, for it can manifest 
physically, and with the most foul 
intent.
HARDING
And what, pray, is that?
VON FRANZ
Like every plague, its only desire 
is to consume all life on earth. It 
is a force more powerful than evil. 
It is death itself.
HARDING boils.
HARDING
I have not slept in days, my house 
is become a bedlam, and here I have 
been re-summoned to this God-
forsaken habitation for this? Do 
not tell me you believe in such 
medieval devilry?!
VON FRANZ looks HARDING in the eye with the profundity of 
Moses reading the commandments:
VON FRANZ
I do not believe. I know.
78.
I have seen things in this world 
that would have made Isaac Newton 
crawl back into his mother’s womb. 
We have not become so much 
enlightened as we have been blinded 
by the gaseous light of science. I 
have wrestled with the Devil as 
Jacob wrestled the angel in Peniel 
and I tell you, if we are to tame 
darkness, we must first face that 
it exists. Meine Herren, we are 
here encountering the un-dead 
plague carrier... the Vampyr... 
Nosferatu!
INT. HARDING HOUSE. MASTER BEDCHAMBER – THE NEXT MOMENT 123

ELLEN and ANNA lie asleep. All is silent. Too silent.
Slowly, a dark SHADOW forms around the large windows. Just as 
slowly, ELLEN opens her eyes.
She rises from bed, her limbs weightless... her heart 
throbbing... her body growing hot... her breath 
accelerating...
She nears the window... she opens it.
She is surrounded by the MIST, almost suspended by it...
SUDDENLY, A HORRIFIC FACE WITH PENETRATING EYES APPEARS TO
HER... she gasps in fear... IT IS ORLOK, and for the first 
time, she faces him in THE FLESH.
She is drawn to him – so drawn to his presence – aflame with 
desire... but she holds herself still.
ELLEN
I have felt you like a serpent 
crawling in my body.
ORLOK
It is not me. It is your nature.
ELLEN
No! I love Thomas.
ORLOK
Love is inferior to you. I told 
you, you are not of human kind.
ELLEN
79.
You are a villain to speak so.
ORLOK
I am an appetite. Nothing more.
He takes a pained breath. The faintest glimmer of something 
human flashes within his eyes.
ORLOK
O’er centuries, a loathsome beast I 
lay within the darkest pit ‘til you 
did wake me, enchantress, and 
stirred me from my grave. You are 
my affliction.
ELLEN
I care nothing of your afflictions.
ORLOK
Yet even now we are fated.
He smiles mockingly. Gloating.
ORLOK
Your husband has signed his name, 
and covenanted you to my person for 
but a sack of gold.
This strikes at ELLEN’S heart. But she doesn’t believe it.
ELLEN
Lies.
ORLOK
For gold he did absolve his nuptial 
bond.
ELLEN
You know nothing of him.
ORLOK
And the resignation must be 
completed by you, freely of thine 
own will.
ELLEN
You are a deceiver!
ORLOK
You deceive yourself.
ELLEN
I was but an innocent child –
80.
ORLOK
And thought you I would not return? 
Thought you I would not? Your 
passion is bound to me.
He reaches his long, leathery fingers toward her... his nails 
grabbing her hair... his fist tightens... drawing her close.
ELLEN
You cannot love.
ORLOK
I cannot. Yet, I cannot be sated 
without you.
His breath is lustful. So is hers. She disgusts herself by 
how drawn she is to him. ORLOK grips her more tightly.
ORLOK
Remember how once we were? A 
moment. Remember?
ELLEN whispers to his hideous and alluring face.
ELLEN
I abhor you.
Pause. This sends Orlok into a rage.
ORLOK
You are false!
He tosses her violently to the floor.
ORLOK
So you wish me to prove my enmity 
as well? I will leave you three 
nights. Tonight was the first. 
Tonight you denied yourself, and 
thereby you suffer me to vanish up 
the lives of those you love.
ELLEN
Denied myself?! You revel in my 
torture!
ORLOK
Dry your cheek. Upon the third 
night you will submit, or he you 
call your husband shall perish by 
my hand.
ELLEN
No!
81.
ORLOK
You will press thy lips to my cold 
mouth and I will drink upon thy 
soul. ‘Til you bid me come, shall 
you watch the world become as 
naught.
ELLEN
NO!!!
IMAGE: ORLOK’S hideous face growls like a virile, predatory 
animal! His claws splayed!
ELLEN SEES IT! HIS GROWL BREAKS HER TRANCE... SHE SCREAMS!
She is no longer at the window... she is back in bed... and 
to her side, ANNA is not there... only her golden cross. 
ELLEN looks across the room...

SIEVERS walks at a feverish pace. A HOSPITAL NURSE by his

Patients are rushed through the hospital on stretchers, the 
besotted marks of sepsis on their skin.
The screaming and pounding echoes through the building. The 
stress, the anxiety is becoming too much.

I ain’t never seen the like. It’s

SIEVERS
We simply cannot admit any more. 
The rate of contraction is too 
high, the deaths so rapid – it’s a 
most desperate hazard. I’ve 
entreated the burgomaster for a 
quarantine. The city must be shut 
up.

HARDING sees THE VAMPIRE BITE on her chest. Does he believe?

I fear little Friedrich is so

HARDING can’t say yes.

poorly and...
HARDING
I know not what to... I shall pray

ELLEN
What of Anna? Did you not see–
HARDING
None of your concern.
ELLEN
Friedrich, you must listen to me, 
we are all in the most grave danger

As ELLEN goes almost to kiss his hand ...
HARDING

ELLEN is hurt. She looks him square in the eye.
ELLEN
Why do you hate me?
Pause. HARDING is shocked by her candour.
HARDING

You have never liked me. Never.

I am a fool. His obsessive 
consumption of living creatures – 
of course it is Herr Knock!
VON FRANZ
He is not Nosferatu - yet he must

storefronts. Using an iron bar, VON FRANZ and SIEVERS break 
in to the agency with a bang!
INT. KNOCK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
131
131
VON FRANZ and SIEVERS go through shelves and cabinets, 
tearing them apart...
VON FRANZ
Search everything.
MOMENTS LATER: His eyes widen. He has found many notes and 
papers in “the secret language.”
MOMENTS LATER: He finds a massive medieval BOOK with THE EVIL 
EYE on the cover. He takes it. He stands and studies the 
room. Beat.
VON FRANZ
Pull up the rug.
He and SIEVERS move KNOCK’S large desk up against a wall. 
They pull back a large, well-worn oriental RUG to reveal... 
KNOCK’S MAGICAL HEPTAGRAM.
VON FRANZ
(knowingly)
Şolomanari.
EXT. WISBURG. OLD TOWN – AFTERNOON
132
132
ELLEN and THOMAS exit the coach, covering their mouths from 
the chlorine gas and billowing smoke from the open fires.
ELLEN carries GRETA in a little wicker cage. THOMAS limps on 
a cane, having difficulty staying conscious.
As they walk, he begins to faint.
ELLEN
Keep with me, my love.
She collects her husband.
ELLEN
We are nearly home.
87.
ELLEN is horrified as she sees TOWN OFFICIALS walking down 
her own street marking a “cross” in chalk upon the doors of 
the afflicted houses.
A raving maniac shouts broken phrases from Revelation. 
Mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters cry and howl, as their 
dead loved ones are loaded onto carts. ELLEN fills with 
tears. She knows it is the work of Orlok.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. REAR DRAWING ROOM – AFTERNOON 133
133
133
HARDING is beginning to look like a broken man. SIEVERS and 
VON FRANZ are with him. The Christmas tree is unlit.
SIEVERS
I could not bring myself to tell 
Anna the source of her illness.
HARDING
This is madness!
SIEVERS
And Friedrich, it seems Herr Knock 
is in league with the creature.
VON FRANZ
Our Nosferatu is of an especial 
malignancy. He is an arch-
enchanter, Şolomonari, Satan’s own 
learnèd disciple.
HARDING
What say you?
VON FRANZ
Further elucidation leads only to 
insanity. Hence the misfortune of 
Herr Knock’s decent. Our 
somnambulist and her husband are in 
incomparable danger!
HARDING
I sent them home.
VON FRANZ
I must see them.
HARDING is about to burst, he is desperate:
HARDING
How can this perversion be killed?
VON FRANZ
88.
I don’t know. You sent them home?
HARDING
(overlapping)
What?
VON FRANZ
You sent them home?
HARDING
(overlapping)
Not that – Yes, I did – You don’t 
know?
VON FRANZ
Precisely. Correct. I do not know. 
I have never encountered Nosferatu 
first hand.
Pause. Everyone is dismayed.
HARDING
He doesn’t know.
VON FRANZ stays confident.
VON FRANZ
(overlapping, ignoring)
Their efficacy is plainly unknown. 
Boiling wine, a spike of cold iron 
transpiercing the navel, 
decapitation, incineration... Yet 
there is one invariable fact that 
interests me most...
SIEVERS
Go on.
VON FRANZ
In every account, the Nosferatu 
must return to the earth wherein it 
was buried, by the first crow of 
cock.
SIEVERS
It must sleep in its grave by day.
(Pause.)
What happens if it does not?
VON FRANZ
That, my dear Sievers, is the 
question.
HARDING begins to laugh. They turn to him. He keeps laughing.
89.
HARDING
Oh, my God. My God! I am shattering 
– I’m breaking apart.
(laughs)
Get out. Take your leave at once.
SIEVERS
Harding?
HARDING
Both of you, go!
SIEVERS
Friedrich, please, we don’t wish to 
–
HARDING
Can’t you see there is a bloody 
real plague, gentlemen? A real 
epidemic that is really killing 
real people?
HARDING
(overlapping)
Jesus Christ in heaven! This isn’t 
a Satanic magician, or any other 
humiliating fantasy. It’s no wonder 
you’re a laughing stock. Out!
SIEVERS
Damn you, Friedrich!
HARDING
My Anna was bitten by vermin. Rats. 
No more. Tomorrow we are leaving 
Wisburg –
SIEVERS
But the quarantine... Tomorrow we 
close off the city.
HARDING
I’m not going to let your vain-
madness kill my wife!
VON FRANZ
The night-daemon has supped of your 
good wife’s blood and shall return 
for the rest!
HARDING
Leave!
VON FRANZ
90.
The Nosferatu will never cease 
unless it is destroyed!
INT. HARDING HOUSE. NURSERY – MOMENTS LATER
134
134
HARDING embraces his children tightly, sitting on the floor 
of the nursery, trying to stay strong. Toys lay strewn about 
around them, looking somehow mournful.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. PARLOUR – NIGHT
135
135
ELLEN sits on the floor attending THOMAS. She has made a 
sickbed on the sofa for him.
He opens his eyes...
ELLEN
Thomas...
ELLEN embraces him. He must save them. He struggles to speak. 
His mind races.
THOMAS
Ellen, my love. We must go. We must 
flee the city. You’re in danger. 
You knew–
ELLEN
We cannot run.
THOMAS
We must –
ELLEN
There is something I must tell you. 
Something so loathsome, so base –
THOMAS
Nothing you can say will shake me – 
for there is a devil in this world, 
and I have met him. And he... I 
cannot speak it – he is come to 
Wisburg... for you.
ELLEN
I know.
THOMAS
What?
ELLEN
I know him.
91.
THOMAS
Know him?
ELLEN
I have brought this evil upon us.
THOMAS is shocked.
ELLEN
I have never shared my secret with 
any soul. I sought company, I 
sought tenderness, and I called 
out...
THOMAS
Ellen –
ELLEN
But Thomas, it was you that gave me 
the courage to be free of my shame 
– you!
THOMAS
What are you telling me?
ELLEN
Don’t you understand?
THOMAS
Pray, help me to.
ELLEN
You cannot understand?
THOMAS
No!
ELLEN
He is my shame! He is my 
melancholy! He took me as his lover 
then, and now he has come back. He 
has discovered our marriage and has 
come back!
THOMAS
Impossible.
THOMAS goes to her. She avoids him as if she were poison.
ELLEN
Don’t touch me. I am not to be 
touched.
92.
SLOWLY, A SHADOW PASSES THROUGH THE ROOM, ORLOK’S BREATH IS 
HEARD.
135A
135A
The Shadow passes over Ellen. Her eyes change. Her tone 
becomes leaden.
ELLEN
You stopped your letters to me.
THOMAS
What?
ELLEN
You promised to write to me every 
day. Did not you think of me in 
that castle?
THOMAS
I did, I–
ELLEN
Lies.
THOMAS
After what you have just confessed, 
how can you –
ELLEN
He told me about you. He told me 
how foolish you were. How fearful. 
How like a child. How you fell into 
his arms as a swooning lily of a 
woman.
THOMAS
Ellen!
ELLEN
He told me how you sold me to him 
for gold.
THOMAS
I–
ELLEN rises from the sofa.
ELLEN
Well where is it? Your money? Your 
promotion? Your house? Where is 
that which is so precious to you? 
Have you paid back kind Harding 
your debt? Have you repaid him with 
this plague that infects his wife?
93.
THOMAS
I left for us, for our future...
ELLEN
For what? For what? For these... 
things?!
ELLEN gestures to the furnishing of the house.
THOMAS
For you!
ELLEN shrieks:
ELLEN
It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t 
matter!!
ELLEN is possessed by anger.
She throws china off the shelves...
Tearing the room to pieces... totally unhinged!
ELLEN
Can’t you see?! It doesn’t matter! 
We should never have married! We 
are already dead!
She screams uncontrollably on the floor! Flailing her arms. 
The veins in her head look like they will explode, her eyes 
crossing. Her hands shake. IT IS UNCANNY. DEMONIC. More 
extreme than she has ever been before. ELLEN BEGINS RIPPING 
HER CLOTHES APART... TEARING AT HER BODICE...
THOMAS
I shall send for Doctor Sievers.
She quickly changes her tone.
ELLEN
No! No!!
She is desperate, crying, she crawls to her husband... She 
grabs his legs to hold him back..
ELLEN
(like a puppy)
Please. I’ll be good, I’ll be good.
She places her cheek against his thigh, slowly looking up at 
him... she whispers in the most sensual and taunting tone:
ELLEN
94.
You could never please me as he 
could.
THOMAS becomes enraged with insane jealousy! He throws her to 
the sickbed... she unbuttons his trousers... he lifts her 
skirts... and they begin making love.
ELLEN
Kiss me.
He does.
ELLEN
Again.
He does.
ELLEN
Again. Kiss me here. Kiss my heart.
He does. ELLEN becomes more aggressive.
ELLEN
Let him see. Let him see our love!
She pushes his head into her heart. Her moaning is animal-
like. She opens his shirt... she sees THE VAMPIRE BITE. She 
kisses and licks it... he pulls her from his chest, afraid... 
She is beyond human passion...
IMAGE: ELLEN, NAKED – HER WHITE FACE – HER MOUTH DRIPPING 
WITH RED BLOOD – HER EYES INSANE!!
THOMAS recoils, terrified by the fleeting image he saw!
THOMAS
Ellen!
She looks him in the eye and laughs in a frightening manner, 
trying to pull him back in to her...
ELLEN
(laughing)
You have unloosed a demon!
THOMAS
Ellen, wake from this. I love you! 
I love you.
Something changes. ELLEN’S laughter turns to shame, to tears. 
She sobs in horror. THOMAS embraces her.
THOMAS
Forgive me, please.
95.
ELLEN
Keep away from me – I am unclean!
THOMAS
Never!
ELLEN
He will murder you if I do not go 
to him. We will be torn apart and 
all will be despair.
Thomas holds her tight, his eyes blaze mercilessly.
THOMAS
I’ll kill him! He shall never harm 
you again. Never!
ELLEN fears it is impossible.
INT. VON FRANZ’S STUDY - NIGHT
136
136
VON FRANZ sits at his desk surrounded with books. He opens up 
Knock’s book with THE EVIL EYE on the cover. It is written in 
the language of the ŞOLOMONARI.
VON FRANZ
(reading)
And so the maiden fair did offer 
up,/ Her love unto the beast, and 
with him lay,/ In close embrace 
until the first cock crow.
He turns to an ILLUSTRATION... IT IS A MEDIEVAL WOODCUT OF A 
YOUNG WOMAN EMBRACING A NOSFERATU-LIKE CORPSE IN BED.
VON FRANZ
Her willing sacrifice thus broke 
the curse,/ And freed them from the 
plague of Nosferatu.
VON FRANZ’S eyes turn inspired. Prophetic.
VON FRANZ
She is the way.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. PARLOUR – NIGHT
137
137
As THOMAS holds ELLEN in his arms, ORLOK’S SHADOW passes 
over, taking her into his dark dreamworld. He whispers to 
her:
ORLOK (V.O.)
96.
More blood shall stain thy hands, 
another night has passed. Tomorrow 
night, the third, shall be his 
last.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. MASTER BEDCHAMBER – NIGHT
138
138
ANNA is in bed. She is near death.
She hears her children crying in the nursery... strange and 
muffled...
She turns to HARDING asleep by her side, fully clothed. One 
hand on hers, the other on a pistol. There is a ghostly 
SHADOW above him.
ORLOK (V.O.)
(subtitled)
Wake not.
ORLOK’S SHADOW quickly ascends away from him like a viper.
CLARA AND LOUISE (O.S.)
The Monster! The Monster!!
ANNA tries to rouse HARDING, shaking him, shaking him with 
all her might – but he will not wake.
ANNA
Friedrich!
A spell is over him. She rushes out of bed...
INT. HARDING HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER 139
139
139
ANNA RUNS TO SAVE HER CHILDREN. THEY SCREAM LIKE MUTILATED 
ANIMALS.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. NURSERY – CONTINUOUS
140
140
She bursts into the nursery... She looks...
Silhouetted by the window, ORLOK DROPS THE LIFELESS BODIES OF 
HER CHILDREN FROM HIS CLAWS... they thump upon the floor.
ANNA is emotionally obliterated – paralysed with fear. She 
tries to go to her children... she can’t move. Her eyes well 
up with tears. She can’t scream. She chokes. She begins to 
shake with insanity, tears flowing from her eyes...
ORLOK approaches... He leaps upon her, engulfing her.
97.
EXT. WISBURG CEMETERY – DAY
141
141
Never was a day more leaden with sorrow. HARDING and two of 
his SERVANTS carry ANNA’S BLACK CASKET out of the hearse, 
into the cemetery gates. PALLBEARERS follow with TWO WHITE 
CHILDREN’S CASKETS. The tall, leafless linden trees that grow 
between headstones seem to mourn the dead.
ELLEN, THOMAS, and SIEVERS have also gathered, unknown to 
HARDING. They watch from afar.
ELLEN looks through her black veil as the pallbearers take 
the caskets into the HARDING FAMILY TOMB – a stately 
mausoleum.
HARDING tries to stay composed as the tomb is closed, but he 
is a broken man. He is deathly pale, his eyes red. Is he, 
too, infected?
SIEVERS
(to Thomas)
We must speak to him.
THOMAS
A moment longer. His grief is too 
great.
Through the fog and snow emerges VON FRANZ, covering his face 
with a handkerchief. ELLEN can feel his approach.
VON FRANZ
More will be taken.
ELLEN
I know. She was with child.
VON FRANZ
Cover your face, dear creature. The 
grim reaper wields his heavy scythe 
with every change of wind.
ELLEN
Professor, I must speak with you.
ELLEN takes VON FRANZ’ hand.
VON FRANZ
And I would speak with you.
SUDDENLY...
141A
141A
HARDING
98.
Take that blackguard from this 
place!
Harding starts for VON FRANZ!
HARDING
Your diseasèd mind has brought all 
of this outrage -
SIEVERS
Stop this!
THOMAS
Friedrich! Stop!
THOMAS runs limping on his cane, and embraces HARDING. THOMAS 
is a man possessed!
THOMAS
Please, it is my fault! Forgive me 
my dear, sweet friend!
THOMAS holds HARDING BACK.
HARDING
This moment doesn’t concern you, 
Thomas!
THOMAS
(overlapping)
Friedrich! These nightmares do 
exist! They exist!
In hysterics, THOMAS tears open his shirt and shows him HIS 
VAMPIRE BITE!
INT/EXT. COACH. WISBURG STREET – DAY
142
142
They are all crammed in a stuffy coach. Windows sealed. ELLEN 
is next to THOMAS.
VON FRANZ looks at ELLEN through her veil.
SIEVERS
(to von Franz)
And he shows no sign of the blood 
plague.
THOMAS
The good sisters sought to nurse me 
back to health with their prayer 
... Yet I fear I am not free of his 
spell–
99.
VON FRANZ
Trust in God and your strength. The 
monster left you to the wolves, and 
yet you prevailed.
SIEVERS
Harding!
HARDING has passed out!
SIEVERS shakes him awake. He is white as a ghost. He looks as 
if he has a brain fever, his eyes darting about – aflame at 
one moment, nearly lustreless the next. He struggles to 
speak.
HARDING
Forgive me. I am not myself. I...
(coughs)
Please, forgive me, all of you. My 
reason could not accept... 
accept...
SIEVERS
(overlapping)
Strength, man. Strength.
VON FRANZ
Orlok has kept his coffin within 
Grünewald Manor?
THOMAS
Assuredly.
VON FRANZ
Under our very noses. Tonight we 
destroy the beast!
ELLEN
Let me come with you.
THOMAS
Of course not, Ellen. You must be 
kept safe away.
VON FRANZ
We shall meet at Harding’s and 
depart to Grünewald Manor.
HARDING
Please. The readiness is all.
Harding says vehemently, yet his thoughts seem far away.
VON FRANZ
100.
We shall sanctify the earth wherein 
he was buried, and destroy the 
sarcophagus, then he can have no 
sanctuary at cock crow.
ELLEN looks at VON FRANZ.
SIEVERS
And when we uncover his body?
THOMAS
I will drive a spike of cold iron 
through him!
VON FRANZ looks at ELLEN.
ELLEN
What if it does not work?
ELLEN keeps staring at VON FRANZ. Determination in her eyes.
THOMAS
It must.
The carriage stops.
ELLEN
Professor, allow me to walk you to 
your door?
EXT. SLUMS. VON FRANZ’S BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 143
143
143
ELLEN walks arm in arm with VON FRANZ. She is stiff, her head 
forward, trying not to give away her secret conversation, as 
her husband is watching from the carriage.
ELLEN
I must know... why me, professor?
VON FRANZ
I am but an able tourist in this 
occult world, you were born to it. 
You tell me why.
ELLEN
His pull on me is so terrible, so 
powerful – yet my spirit cannot be 
evil as his.
VON FRANZ
101.
We must know evil to be able to 
destroy it, we must discover it 
within ourselves. And when we have, 
we must crucify the evil within us, 
or there is no salvation.
ELLEN
I need no salvation. My entire life 
I have done no ill but heed my 
nature.
VON FRANZ
Then harken to it. I fear Nosferatu 
is impervious to any of our iron 
stakes. I believe only you have the 
faculty to redeem us.
THOMAS (O.S.)
Ellen! Let us make haste.
VON FRANZ smiles.
VON FRANZ
In heathen times you might have 
been a great priestess of Isis. 
Yet, in this strange and modern 
world your purpose is of greater 
worth.
ELLEN looks at VON FRANZ with an eternal calm. She smiles. 
She has always known what is destined.
ELLEN
Thank you.
She kisses his hand.
VON FRANZ
I will keep your husband at bay 
tonight. Go now. Go home. Attend 
him that he is sturdy for this 
false hunt.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. PARLOUR – AFTERNOON
144
144
ELLEN sits by a WINDOW COVERED IN WREATHES OF GARLIC AND 
WHITETHORN. She looks through the wavy glass: makeshift 
undertakers carry coffins down an abandoned street. Fires 
burn. Rats feed on dead horses and dogs. The city is a 
morgue. SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE MUST DO. NO MORE SHALL DIE FROM 
THIS.
THOMAS kisses her head, wearing his coat, ready to leave.
102.
ELLEN
You will put an end to all of this?
She has to be sure that she will be left alone this night. 
This is a loving deceit, a vital deceit.
ELLEN
You promise you shan't return to me 
‘til he is no more? Promise you 
won’t return-
THOMAS
I promise.
ELLEN
He does not have power over you, 
Thomas.
They embrace. Tears fall from her eyes. She knows this moment 
is their last together.
ELLEN
I place my utter faith in you. I 
love you.
THOMAS
Cry not.
Their final kiss. THOMAS leaves, ever empowered by his wife.
HOLD ON: ELLEN, feeling her imminent destiny stir within her.
ELLEN
(whispered)
Goodbye.
INT. HARDING HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY
145
145
THOMAS, SIEVERS, and VON FRANZ stand with weapons ready, as 
VAMPIRE HUNTERS.
SIEVERS
He is not here?
HARTMAN
No, Herr Harding has departed, sir.
THOMAS
Where could he have gone?
VON FRANZ
103.
He has a heavy grief. We shall wait 
for him. There is time yet ‘til 
sundown.
VON FRANZ casually lights his pipe.
THOMAS
No. We must find him.
EXT. WISBURG CEMETERY – DUSK
146
146
HARDING wanders in the blue twilight. Snow falls.
He approaches his FAMILY TOMB. The red marks of sepsis are on 
his haunted face, discharge in his eyes. HE HAS THE PLAGUE.
As he unlocks the vault, without noticing, he lets his huge 
fur coat fall off of his shoulders into the snow.
INT. HARDING FAMILY TOMB - MOMENTS LATER
147
147
He seems in a trance, his eyes full of tears.
HARDING
Clara. Louise. My girls.
He gently touches their coffins as he walks by them, with a 
melancholy smile, as if stroking his daughters’ cheeks.
EXT. WISBURG STREET – DUSK
148

THE VAMPIRE HUNTERS call for HARDING. THOMAS limps on his 
cane.
INT. HARDING FAMILY TOMB – DUSK

149
HARDING sees ANNA’S COFFIN on a stone bier.
HARDING
(whispered)
Anna. Your bed is so dark, so 
small.
He hugs and caresses the lid.
HARDING
Anna, my love. Our son ... our 
little son ... forgive me. I shall 
never sleep again. Never.
104.
He breathes with desire, slowly opening the coffin.
He takes her limp head passionately in his arms. Suddenly... 
he is seized with an internal haemorrhage... the plague 
ripping at him. Blood trickles from his mouth. But his love 
for his wife is enough to withstand the pain.
HARDING
Let this your tender embrace keep 
me now in bliss, away from 
everlasting sleep.
Quivering with passion, and in his death throes, he brings 
his wife’s cold lips to his.
EXT. HARBOUR – DUSK

THE VAMPIRE HUNTERS run through the cemetery.
INT. HARDING FAMILY TOMB – NIGHT
152
152
They dash in... stunned... THOMAS lowers his torch:
ANNA’S CASKET IS TUMBLED OVER. SHE LIES HALF INSIDE, HALF ON 
THE FLOOR... HARDING IS DEAD, TOO. HE HOLDS HER IN HIS ARMS, 
SKIRTS FLOWING AROUND HER HUSBAND. HER LEG WRAPPED AROUND 
HIM. HE COULD NOT RESIST HER. THE PLAGUE HAS TAKEN THEM BOTH.
THOMAS
I cannot bear anymore!
VON FRANZ
Set fire to their infected bodies. 
They must be sanctified.
THOMAS
Please, we must onward.
SIEVERS
105.
But Orlok... Will he not have 
already risen? Should we not return 
to our homes?
THOMAS
No. I will not wait ‘til morning! 
We must stop him now.
VON FRANZ
Very wise, young Thomas.
VON FRANZ seems somehow suspicious to Thomas. SIEVERS notices 
THOMAS trembling.
THOMAS
I feel his hold upon me this night.
SIEVERS
Make haste, Professor!
VON FRANZ prays and nods to SIEVERS who remorsefully douses 
the bodies in coal oil.
THE MEN slowly lower their torches to cremate their friends.

THOMAS
There is a chapel in the rear.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT
159
159
ELLEN TAKES DOWN THE GARLIC AND WHITETHORN...
She flings the window open... wind blows. She slowly raises 
her arms, beckoning, like a sorceress... radiant...
SHE SPEAKS TO ORLOK WITHOUT OPENING HER MOUTH. 
TELEPATHICALLY.
ELLEN (V.O.)
(whispered)
I am ready. I bid you, come to me.
INT. GRÜNEWALD MANOR. CHAPEL - SAME MOMENT
160
160
ORLOK walks through the chapel, into the shadows. The high-
pitched screeching of RATS grows louder and louder...
ORLOK STOPS WALKING. HE TURNS HIS HEAD. HE HEARS ELLEN.
ORLOK (V.O.)
Behold the third night.
INT. GRÜNEWALD MANOR. CHAPEL – MOMENTS LATER
161
161
THE VAMPIRE HUNTERS burst open the doors of the chapel. 
Pigeons fly.
THEY SEE IT, in the distance: ORLOK’S SARCOPHAGUS!
THOMAS
There it is!
THEN, THEY GASP! THERE ARE RATS EVERYWHERE. THOUSANDS PILED 
UP, FRANTICALLY CRAWLING.
SIEVERS
Oh god.
THEY ARE ANKLE DEEP IN RATS!
VON FRANZ lowers his torch.
107.
VON FRANZ
The fire will keep them at bay.
It works... They lower their torches, keeping the rats 
away... walking in fear.
VON FRANZ
Go forward Thomas. Set free the 
daemon’s body!
SIEVERS throws open the coffin lid with ferocity.
THOMAS without so much as looking... THRUSTS IN HIS IRON 
SPIKE AND HAMMERS IT! But SIEVERS sees into the box before 
THOMAS:
SIEVERS
No, Thomas!!
AN OLD, THIN, PALE ARM JUTS OUT OF THE BOX IN AGONY! BLOOD!! 
AN OLD MAN’S SCREAM!
THOMAS looks: IT IS NO VAMPIRE – IT IS KNOCK, NAKED IN 
ORLOK’S DIRT! THE STAKE DEEP IN HIS GUT.
SIEVERS
Herr Knock!
KNOCK holds the stake, blood pouring from his mouth.
KNOCK
I relinquished him my soul...
KNOCK pushes the stake deeper into his body. His eyes look 
kind.
KNOCK
I should have been the Prince of 
Rats – immortal... but he broke our 
covenant... for he cares only for 
his pretty bride.
THOMAS
Ellen!
KNOCK
She is his!
THOMAS realises what he has just said... AND that he has left 
Ellen at home... AS PREY!
THOMAS
Monstrous!
108.
KNOCK
Strike again. I am blasphemy!
VON FRANZ takes a mallet from THOMAS...
THOMAS
No!
VON FRANZ drives the stake into KNOCK’S navel!
VON FRANZ
Die you accursèd mis-birth of Hell!
KNOCK
Deliverance...
KNOCK dies.
VON FRANZ
Set fire to it all!
VON FRANZ incants prayers, dousing the earth and Knock’s body 
with coal oil.
THOMAS
Dammit man, he has gone to my wife!
VON FRANZ
We must burn it! We must destroy 
all of his habitation. No 
sanctuary.
He pours the oil everywhere lighting everything on fire.
THOMAS
There is not time to be lost, he 
pursues Ellen!
VON FRANZ pays no attention to THOMAS. The flames grow.
VON FRANZ
By holy Paul, there is no remission 
without her blood!!
(laughs)
THOMAS and SIEVERS realise that VON FRANZ knew it all along!
SIEVERS
You are a mad man!
THOMAS
(overlapping)
You knew Orlok would not be here! 
You knew it this afternoon!
109.
VON FRANZ
Your wife wills it!!
THOMAS
This is not moral!!
VON FRANZ
God is beyond our morals.
THOMAS runs savagely at VON FRANZ. SIEVERS holds him back. 
VON FRANZ laughs in a religious fervour!
VON FRANZ
In vain! In vain!
(laughs)
THOMAS FILLS WITH TEARS OF RAGE. He turns away, running to 
Ellen. SIEVERS follows. The flames growing wild. RATS SCREAM!
VON FRANZ
You run in vain! You cannot out-run 
your destiny! (laughs) Her dark 
bond with the beast shall redeem us 
all. For when Jove’s pure light 
shall break upon the dawn: 
Redemption. (laughs) The plague 
shall be lifted! (laughs)

INT. HUTTER HOUSE. BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME
163
163
ELLEN stands by the window, ready for her fate. The flames of 
Grünewald Manor flicker miles away.
She hears heavy footsteps...
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
164
164
ORLOK is in her house... ascending the stairs...
His breathing growing louder...
His approach growing closer...
Closer...
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. HALL - THE NEXT MOMENT
165
165
THE SHADOW OF ORLOK’S claw reaches the door of the bedroom.
110.
His breathing is louder still.
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MOMENT
166
166
ELLEN turns to the door, trembling. SHE WEARS HER WEDDING 
DRESS. Dried lilacs from her wedding adorn her hair, like a 
crown. She is prepared to be wed to death, as her dream 
foretold...
ORLOK enters the room.
ORLOK
(Ancient Dacian, 
subtitled)
You accept this, of your own will?
Their eyes of infinite depth meet each other.
ELLEN
I do.
ORLOK
(subtitled)
Then the covenant is fulfilled. 
Your oath re-pledged.
ELLEN
Yes.
ORLOK
(subtitled)
As our spirits are one, so too 
shall be our flesh. You are mine.
He breathes with obsession.
A tear falls from her eye.
They embrace. His grasp is overwhelming. Violent. 
Frightening.
She pulls away in fear. He pulls tighter. His shrunken corpse 
mouth is bloody. He kisses her. Deeply. It is ecstasy for 
both of them.
She leads him to the bed...
She undresses...
He caresses her body with his claws... She draws him to her 
heart, where she had wished Thomas would kiss her...
111.
He opens his rat-like jaws, lifts up his head and sinks his 
teeth into her breast, penetrating her flesh!
She shudders. She moans. She holds his cold skull close as he 
drinks her blood. Her whole body throbs as the blood rushes 
out of her veins... She holds him tighter... Her breathing 
bursts with rapture.
EXT. WISBURG - DAWN
167
167
WIDE: Wisburg, the plague-ridden city, awaits redemption. THE 
FIRST GOLDEN RAYS OF DAWN grow in the horizon behind the city 
skyline. In the distance, A ROOSTER CROWS.
EXT. WISBURG STREET – DAWN
168
168
THOMAS and SIEVERS run.
THOMAS sees the amber sky and SUNLIGHT breaking upon the 
steeple of THE CHURCH. He quickens his pace, running himself 
to death – he will save Ellen!
INT. HUTTER HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
169
169
ORLOK’S jaws are still latched to Ellen’s breast, though he 
is engorged.
He senses the DAWN and begins to rise, but Ellen lovingly 
guides him back to her. She whispers almost inaudibly:
ELLEN
More. More.
He cannot resist. He drinks. She holds him close.
As he drinks, THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN ASCENDING INTO THE 
ROOM. He feels the warmth - afraid.
ELLEN LOOKS AT HIM. HE SEES A FIERY RECKONING IN HER EYES. 
SHE HAS WON.
He slowly rises... The sunlight rakes over him... He puts up 
his hands to shield himself...
THE LIGHT IS OBLITERATING NOSFERATU!
In agony, he contorts himself into a twisted position... 
Ellen’s blood oozes from all of his orifices. He screams... 
his lungs shredded by the cry.
112.
JUST THEN, THOMAS AND SIEVERS RUSH IN, GASPING AT WHAT THEY 
SEE!
THOMAS
Ellen!
ORLOK FALLS ONTO ELLEN, BOTH OF THEM EPILEPTICALLY WRITHING 
IN AN ANGUISHED AND PUTRID BALLET. CLIMAXING.
THOMAS SPRINGS TO THE BED... BUT IT IS TOO LATE. THOMAS falls 
to his knees in despair.
ELLEN gently touches THOMAS. ELLEN AND THOMAS EXCHANGE ONE 
FINAL LOOK OF LOVE, AS SHE AND ORLOK DIE.
Thomas holds his wife’s lifeless hand tightly. Beautiful, 
pure, golden light shines through the windows behind him.
VON FRANZ walks into the bedroom, solemnly removing his hat. 
He puts his hand on THOMAS’ shoulder. THOMAS doesn’t feel it.
VON FRANZ holds a bouquet of LILACS which he scatters upon 
the remains of Ellen and Orlok. Just as he crosses himself, 
GRETA crawls by and leaps up into his arms. He pets her and 
smiles as she nestles up to him.
ELLEN and ORLOK lay dead together, their limbs entwined in 
carnage and the fragrant lilacs. Orlok is now an empty shell. 
ELLEN’S face is calm, beatific. Finally at peace.
HOLD.
THE END.
