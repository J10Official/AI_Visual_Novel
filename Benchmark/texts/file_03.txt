Maria had always been fascinated by her grandmother's garden. The old woman claimed that her vegetables grew larger and more flavorful than anyone else's in the neighborhood, but she never revealed her secret. When Maria inherited the house after her grandmother's passing, she discovered something unusual in the garden shed.

Hidden behind rusty tools and forgotten flower pots, she found an ornate wooden box containing seeds unlike any she had ever seen. They shimmered with an iridescent quality and felt warm to the touch. A handwritten note in her grandmother's careful script read: "Plant under the full moon. Water with morning dew. Speak kindly to them daily."

Skeptical but curious, Maria followed the instructions precisely. She planted the mysterious seeds during the next full moon, collected dew from rose petals each morning, and found herself talking to the emerging sprouts as if they were old friends.

Within weeks, the garden transformed into something extraordinary. Tomatoes grew as large as melons, carrots spiraled in perfect golden helixes, and flowers bloomed in colors that seemed to shift with the light. Neighbors began stopping by, drawn by the garden's unusual beauty and the inexplicable sense of peace they felt there.

Maria realized her grandmother had left her more than just a house – she had inherited magic itself, disguised as simple gardening wisdom.
