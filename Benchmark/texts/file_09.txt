The last lighthouse keeper on Earth maintained his vigil not for ships that would never come, but for signals from civilizations that had transcended physical existence eons ago. Silas had inherited the position from his father, who had inherited it from his father, in an unbroken chain stretching back to when humanity first learned to listen to the electromagnetic songs of departed worlds.

The lighthouse itself was a technological marvel disguised as Victorian architecture – its beacon was actually a quantum entanglement communicator, capable of receiving transmissions from beings who had evolved beyond matter into pure consciousness. Each night, Silas translated their messages: philosophical treatises encoded in gravitational waves, poetry written in the language of particle decay, love songs that existed as mathematical equations describing the curvature of spacetime around dying stars.

Tonight's transmission was different. The signal arrived not as the usual ethereal whisper but as an urgent cascade of data that overloaded the receiver's crystalline matrices. As Silas decoded the message, his blood chilled: "The Watchers have noticed your species. Your broadcast signatures have reached the attention of entities that consume civilizations which mature too quickly. Silence your transmissions. Hide in the quantum shadows. We who transcended remember the terror of being young and loud in a universe full of ancient predators."

Silas faced an impossible choice. Humanity's greatest achievement – the ability to communicate with transcendent beings – might have been their death sentence. He looked at the lighthouse's beacon, humanity's voice calling out into the cosmic dark, and wondered whether he should extinguish it forever or continue broadcasting, hoping that courage might prove more valuable than caution in the vast, watchful silence of space.
