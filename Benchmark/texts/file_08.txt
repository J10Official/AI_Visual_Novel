The memory merchant operated from a shop that existed only on Tuesdays, nestled between a bakery and a bookstore on Meridian Street. Customers came seeking to trade painful recollections for cherished ones, though few understood the true cost of such exchanges until after the transaction was complete.

Evangeline had lost her daughter in an accident three years prior, and the grief had crystallized into a weight that made breathing difficult. The merchant, an ageless woman with silver hair that moved like liquid mercury, offered her a trade: the memory of loss for the memory of her daughter's first steps, preserved in pristine detail from another timeline where tragedy never struck.

"Memory," the merchant explained while handling the extracted experiences like delicate glass orbs, "is not linear recording but probability collapsed into narrative. I trade in the quantum foam of what-might-have-been, offering alternative histories where pain transforms into joy."

The procedure was surprisingly gentle – a touch to the temples, a sensation like warm honey flowing through neural pathways, and suddenly Evangeline's grief transformed into bittersweet nostalgia. She remembered her daughter living to adulthood, remembered graduation ceremonies and wedding dances that had never occurred in her original timeline.

But memory, she discovered, carries its own weight. The borrowed happiness felt simultaneously real and artificial, leaving her suspended between authentic sorrow and manufactured joy. She began to question whether healing required experiencing pain fully rather than exchanging it for someone else's unrealized dreams, wondering if the merchant's gift was salvation or another form of elaborate imprisonment.
