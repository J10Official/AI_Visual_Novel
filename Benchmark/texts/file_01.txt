Tom woke up. He got out of bed. He went to the kitchen. He made coffee. The coffee was hot. He drank it. Then he went to work. Work was at an office. He sat at his desk. He typed on his computer. At lunch time he ate a sandwich. The sandwich had ham and cheese. After lunch he worked more. At five o'clock he went home. He watched TV. He ate dinner. Dinner was pasta. After dinner he watched more TV. Then he went to bed. He was tired. The next day he did the same thing. This happened every day. Tom's life was the same every day. He did not like change. Change scared him. But one day something different happened. He found a letter under his door. The letter was from his old friend. His friend wanted to visit. Tom was nervous about this. He had not seen his friend in years. But he decided to say yes. Maybe change would be good. The friend came to visit the next week. They had a good time together. Tom realized that change was not so bad after all.
