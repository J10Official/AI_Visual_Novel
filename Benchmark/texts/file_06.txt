The clockmaker's apprentice discovered that time itself was broken on the morning when yesterday's sunrise appeared in the eastern window while tomorrow's moon hung pale in the western sky. Magnus had been working alone in the workshop, carefully adjusting the intricate gears of the Grand Chronometer – a mysterious device his master had forbidden him to touch.

Now the consequences of his curiosity rippled through reality like cracks in glass. Pedestrians walked backward down the cobblestone streets while simultaneously moving forward, their conversations flowing in reverse loops. Children aged into elders between breakfast and lunch, then reverted to infancy by dinnertime. The baker's fresh bread crumbled to dust, then reconstituted itself in an endless cycle of creation and decay.

Magnus realized the Chronometer wasn't merely a timepiece – it was the heart of temporal order itself, maintaining the delicate balance that kept moments flowing in their proper sequence. His inexperienced adjustments had created temporal eddies, whirlpools in the stream of time that threatened to tear apart the fabric of causality.

Working with desperate precision, Magnus attempted to reverse his modifications, but each correction seemed to spawn new paradoxes. He watched in horror as cause began following effect, as shadows preceded their casters, as words returned to speakers' mouths before being spoken.

The solution, when it came, required him to embrace the impossible: to repair time, he would need to step outside it entirely, becoming unstuck from the very sequence he sought to restore.
