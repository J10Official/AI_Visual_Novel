In the moments between heartbeats, Zara learned to slip into the quantum interstices where possibility branched into infinite permutations. She was a probability surgeon, one of the few humans capable of navigating the microscopic gaps in causality where free will actually resided – those infinitesimal decision points where the universe fractured into countless potential futures.

Her client today was a man whose daughter existed in a superposition of life and death following a car accident. In the macroscopic world, she was brain-dead, but at the quantum level, her consciousness flickered between states of being and non-being, trapped in a Schrödinger-like limbo that prevented either complete death or recovery.

Zara inserted herself into the quantum foam surrounding the accident's moment of impact, where she could observe the branching paths of causality like a vast, luminous tree. In this realm, time moved differently – she could spend subjective hours exploring probability branches that existed for nanoseconds in standard spacetime. Each branch represented a different decision: the father leaving work five minutes later, the other driver stopping for coffee, a traffic light staying yellow for one second longer.

The challenge wasn't finding a branch where the daughter survived – dozens of those timelines gleamed with possibility. The true art lay in collapsing the superposition without creating paradoxes that would ripple backward through causality, potentially unraveling the father's existence entirely. Zara had to perform quantum surgery with the precision of a master clockmaker, adjusting probability gradients so subtly that the universe would accept the new timeline as if it had always been the only possible outcome.

As she worked, she wondered whether she was performing miracles or simply discovering that miracles had always been possible for those willing to operate in the spaces between certainty and chaos.
