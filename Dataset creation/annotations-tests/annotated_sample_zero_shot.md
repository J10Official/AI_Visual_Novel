- Mike goes to "GOOGLE." He types in "DOLPHIN HOTEL NEW YORK"
- Beat. A page of text appears. Mike clicks on a link to the Dolphin. 
A millisecond pause — then the Dolphin's stylish homepage appears.
It is exactly what one would expect: Chandeliers. Clinking champagne flutes. Links to SPA, DINING, BANQUET FACILITIES, RESERVATIONS...
- **ANNOTATION**: Mike knows this is a dead end. He clicks back to "GOOGLE," then tries "DOLPHIN HOTEL GHOSTS"

Mike sits in a musty library basement scrolling through MICROFICHE rolls. On the amber screen is an ancient New York Herald-Tribune: The headline screams "FACTORY OWNER LEAPS FROM HOTEL." 
There is a portrait of a stuffy-looking rich man, then underneath a gory WEEGEE-LIKE PHOTO of a bloody mess on a New York sidewalk, the cops dourly cleaning up.
For the first time, Mike seems affected. Truly bothered.

A spooky pause... when suddenly — RING!!
It's his CELLPHONE.
Mike jumps, startled. Embarrassed by the noise, he quickly answers it.
MIKE
Hello?
- **ANNOTATION**: But, nothing. Mike frowns.
MIKE
Hello! This is Mike Enslin. Is anybody there?
No response. Just — a faint crackling STATIC.
Mike struggles to hear — when CLICK. The line goes dead.

A prim woman in round spectacles.

# Scene: The third painting - a British hunting scene.

**MIKE (O.S.)**
"The third and final, painfully-dull painting is the ever popular 
"The Hunt" — horses, hounds, and 
constipated British lords."
(beat)
"These paintings have been here a 
long time. If I lifted them, I'm 
sure I'd see light patches. Or squirming bugs like when you turn 
over a rock."

**BACK ON MIKE**
MIKE
"The bedroom has a queen-size bed, 
two nightstands, and butterfly 
wallpaper."
(beat)
"Some smartass spoke of the 
banality of evil. If that’s so, then we've entered the seventh ring 
of Hell."
Mike gets up and walks to the window. He opens the drapes.
OUTSIDE, another building completely fills the view. Below 
are cars and a huge lit-up BANK CLOCK. Mike opens the paned 
window. Traffic noise rises in.
MIKE
"The panorama is a typical cramped 
New York view of nothing: A gray 
building, and honking traffic 
below,"

The clock outside clicks from 7:59 to 8:00 PM.
Suddenly, LOUD MUSIC.
Mike jumps, startled.
34.

**BEHIND HIM**
36
36
The clock RADIO has gone off. The CARPENTERS sing:
THE CARPENTERS (O.S.)
(singing)
We’ve only just begun"

Mike laughs. He turns it OFF, flicking the alarm switch.
MIKE
Silly..

Mike turns — then suddenly freezes.
THE BED
is turned down. The sheet is folded, and there are little 
mint chocolates on the pillows.
MIKE
gapes, stupefied.
MIKE
Holy shiiit!

Mike blinks, as if this will make the mints disappear.
But they don't.

He strolls over and picks up a mint. He peers...
MIKE
Bravo, Olin. That is VERY 
unsettling.
Mike opens the candy, then EATS it. He thinks, his wheels 
spinning. Until he suddenly stops, mid-chew.
MIKE
That means someone’s in the room..

Mike whirls.
WIDE
Emboldened, Mike RUNS to the CLOSET. He slams open the door 
and — it's empty.

Hm. Mike looks around. Ah! Suddenly he drops to his knees and 
peers under the BED. Buz... there’s nothing.

35.

**Hm! Mike thinks. He bolts into the bathroom. He grabs the 
shower curtain, takes a breath, then YANKS it aside.
And — nobody. Huh?!
Mike wracks his mind. Tantalized.

MIKE
Come out, come out...
Detective-like, he starts RAPPING on the drywall.
RAP! RAP RAP!

He RAPS his way toward the door... when... something catches 
his eye.
TIGHT - TOILET PAPER
The toilet paper roll has returned to its original state.

Once again, it has a folded triangle.
ANGLE - MIKE
His eyes bulge.
MIKE
Whoa. Bizarre.

(beat)
A ghost that offers turndown 
service.
He gawks at it. Then, he pulls out his recorder, CLICK!

MIKE
"Okay, let’s Encyclopedia Brown 
this fucker. I was facing the 
window. Then I saw the mints, ran 
to the closet which would leave 
time for Houdini to get in the 
bathroom, do the paper trick —
(he stops)

"No, I would've seen him —
(beat)
"No. Unless he started in the 
bathroom, so when I turned my back, 
he did the mints and escaped 
into... the living room!"

Mike barrels into the
INT. LIVING ROOM

**MIKE**
He lopes around — searching... searching.
Until, he spots - 
the AIR VENT up in the ceiling.
Ah! Mike runs up — and thinks he sees movement inside.

Or, does he?

He stands on his tiptoes and SHOUTS up into it.
MIKE
Hellooo! -Hello, asshole! You're 
gonna have to try harder!
(he smirks)

Nice and HOT up there??
Mike wipes his brow. He realizes he's sweating.
Mike runs to the THERMOSTAT and checks it. It’s now 84.

MIKE
Oh, for God's sake.
Mike pushes the "down" arrow again. Nothing. He BANGS it.

Irked, he grabs the clunky telephone, peers at the archaic 
dial, then sticks his finger in the hole and dials "O."
It spins. Click-click-click-click-click. Then —
MIKE
Hello! This is Mr. Enslin in Room 
1408.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Good evening. Are you ready to 
check out?

MIKE
"Check out"?!
(he chuckles mordantly)
Why would I do that, when there a 
such wonderful maid service?
(beat)

And so discreet!

(beat)
No, I just need someone to fix my 
thermostat. This room's on fire.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Of course, sir. We'll send an 
engineer right up.

MIKE
Thanks.
37.
Mike hangs up.
Beat. Through the wall, the baby CRIES. Waaah! Waaah...

Mike considers it all. He sits on the sofa, then starts his 
recorder.
MIKE
"Hotel rooms are naturally creepy. I mean, how many people have slept 
in that bed before you? How many 
were sick? How many lost their 
minds?
(beat)
"How many died?"

**MIKE**
Mike thinks. He unzips his duffel, slides over his LAPTOP, 
and carefully removes a small EQUIPMENT CASE. Inside is 
assorted gear: An EMF meter, microphones, a UV black light.

ACROSS THE ROOM
Mike dims the room. Then, he turns on the UV light. It HUMS, 
emitting a weird blue glow. He holds the tube over the carpet 
stain, and it GLOWS, vivid and brackish.

Hm. Mike waves the UV light around the room. Things are 
revealed, the past becoming otherworldly and phosphorescent:
Spatters on the drapes.
Multicolored blotches on the couch.
Drips across the walls.
Soiled puddles in the bed.

MIKE
is repelled. Ugh. He feels sick.
Unable to bear any more, he FLICKS ON the lights.
Normalcy is restored. Mike rubs his eyes, then returns to the 
living room. He glances at

**THE THREE PAINTINGS**
Which are... askew. Just slightly... tilted.
The ship’s crooked horizon is unpleasantly vivid...

CU - MIKE
38.

A strange, sealike sensation. He staggers, a bit nauseous.
A SOUND of pounding waves. The painted water seems real...
Mike is losing his equilibrium.
MIKE
God, I feel like I smoked some 
cheap dope!
He straightens the three paintings, then turns away.
Mike takes a step — then — suddenly gets a look.
He spins!

The paintings are still straight.
Hm. Mike queasily sits, putting his head between his legs.

Overheated, he fumbles for his recorder,
MIKE
What did Olin say?
(dizzy)
Something about poison gas...?

A woozy, unclear contemplation.... when — BZZZZ!
WIDE
Mike jerks. BZZZZ! It’s the door, He pops from his trance.
MIKE
W-who is it??
GRUFF VOICE
Engineering. You got a problem with 
your heat?
Mike scurries to the door. He peers through the EYEHOLD.

Through the glass, a hairy New York ENGINEER in overalls.

# Scene: 
Hair. Darkness. Then FLASH!
The painting changes; Grandma is now standing, staring out.
FLASH!
The old lady turns into THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN from the lobby.
Her breast is bare, BLOOD drips from her nipple, down, into 
her baby’s open mouth. The baby’s face is blue, dead.
FLASH
I THE PAINTING OF THE SAILORS
turns into a ROTTING GHOST SHIP. They sail into a roiling 
sea, covered in black clouds. The seamen's faces are pale, 
starving, staring hopelessly.
Mike turns, shaky. FLASH!
THE PAINTING OF THE HUNT
The British men in red coats and hats get pulled off their 
horses by the dogs. The dogs RIP the men apart, tearing their 
flesh.
MIKE
whimpers. Around him, rain pours harder. WHOOOSH1 A TORNADO­ 
LIKE SOUND roars. A liquid churning, growing louder...
Mike covers his ears and careens through the sopping mess, 
shivering, looking for a way out. His feet smoosh in the 
soaking carpet.
MIKE
passing the Thermostat. It's dropped to 48 DEGREES.
He pounds on the closed-up windows.
He tugs on the door.
Wind BLOWS fiercer. A BLAST OF COLD gushes from the AIR VENT, 
blowing the shirt down.
MIKE’s eyes narrow, thinking. Intrigued, he takes a step 
closer to the VENT...
71
MIKE
Ho ho. That goes somewhere. Maybe I 
can just pull a Bruce Willis.
Mike CLAMBERS UP onto the desk. He's right beneath the grate. 
He takes out his PENLIGHT and shines it up through the 
opening.
INSIDE THE VENT
It's dark, foreboding. In the shadows is the: black tube.
MIKE
putting his face up to it.
ANGLE - MIKE
MIKE
Hello, perv. I'm coming to get you.
he tugs the grate -— it's fastened with four bolts. Fine. He 
hurriedly pulls out his trusty LETTER OPENER and starts to 
use it as a screwdriver...
MIKE
Okay. Here goes nothin'.
Mike unscrews the first bolt. It falls to the ground.
An anxious pause — then he quickly unscrews the second bolt.
The third.
The fourth.
Wary, Mike reaches and slowly pulls the grate off the 
ceiling.
he drops it, watching it hit the floor with a CLANG.
Beat — then he slowly turns back to the now-open vent.
Suddenly, he LUNGES at the tiny black tube and GRABS it.
MIKE
HA!!!
Mike squeezes it in his fist -- then reacts, surprised.
CLOSEUP - MIKE'S HAND
he's holding a roll of DUCT TAPE. That’s all.
ANGLE - MIKE
72
A bewildered silence.
MIKE
There's... nobody watching me??!
(long pause; confused)
Why am I disappointed?
A halting moment. He gathers his wits, then stares into the 
open VENT.
INSIDE THE VENT
It's metal DARKNESS. Air WHOOSHES sinisterly.
Mike gulps, then waves his pathetic letter opener. he SHOUTS.
MIKE
I've got a knife!
No response.
Mike steels himself, then painfully lifts his body up into...
INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - SAME TIME
51
51
Mike clangs onto the hard cold surface. He pulls his legs up.
Inside, it's black. We can’t see a foot ahead.
Mike aims his penlight, but it’s just a dull glow. Shadows 
and rat droppings.
Mike takes a breath, then squirms forward.
It's murky and unsettling. The air BLASTS. Mike slithers 
along... unsure, creeped-out. Until, his penlight reveals
A JUNCTION AHEAD
A "T" split. Shafts go left and right.
Mike stops — not sure where to go. He shines the tiny light 
both ways... but the beam disappears into dimness.
then — faint VOICES.
Mike's eyes bulge.
The VOICES are from the right.
Mike gets excited. Other people! he scrambles down the vent.
MIKE
73
Hey! Hey!!
Not far, he sees LIGHT. It's coming from a GRATE in the floor 
of the shaft!
Mike hustles faster. He reaches the grate — then looks down.
BELOW - HOTEL ROOM
It's the next Hotel Room. From above, we see the Young Mother 
holding her CRYING baby.
YOUNG MOTHER
Shh, shh. Mama loves her baby...
The Baby WAILS harder.
the Mother turns — REVEALING SHE'S LILY. Young Lily, from the 
PAST.
LILY
C’mon, Grade. Stop crying.
(frazzled)
No, I don’t know where your daddy 
is. probably boozing it up...
MIKE
goes ashen.
MIKE
n-no...! Honey, I’m here...
YOUNG LILY
can't hear him. She carries Baby Grade into the next room.
MIKE
is tormented. he scurries to follow her. he rushes along the 
vent. Banging himself on the sharp metal —
MIKE
Ow! Wait —
he spots the next GRATE. Braced, he rushes over to it -- then 
GASPS.
BELOW
is a PARK. Trees, a path.
then two men walk by. Young Mike from the PAST, arguing with 
his Father. Father is younger, healthy.
74
FATHER
Mike, don’t do this! She needs you.
(reticent)
She lost a child, too.
YOUNG MIKE
(enraged)
Why do you always lecture me?
FATHER
I'm not --
YOUNG MIKE
I’m an adult! I can make my own 
decisions!
Mike storms away.
MIKE IN THE VENT
His face collapses* Pained by the memory.
he stares mutely, then feels something strange. Icky. he 
turns the penlight on his hand...
And crawling across his fingers is a COCKROACH.
MIKE
Ugh...!
Mike brushes away the bug. The penlight’s beam swings — 
revealing HUNDREDS OF ROACHES. The VENT IS FESTERING.
MIKE
YEOGGH!
Grossed-out, Mike hurriedly BACKS UP. Rushing backwards 
through the vent.
Hurry!
the beam rolls, grazing across skittering bugs.
Mike rushes faster. His breathing echoes through the 
claustrophic metal.
Suddenly, he reaches a junction — and DROPS.
Aggh!! he's plunged down a
VERTICAL SHAFT
Mike plummets into blackness, falling backwards!
75
he flails, then SLAMS his hand, just catching the edge.
Hanging on for dear life.
Mike glances down. It’s ABSOLUTLY BLACK below.
With a rush of adrenaline, Mike struggles to pull himself out 
Straining, muscles clenching... he lifts himself up.
Okay. Mike sucks in air. Resolved, he whirls about to race 
forward —
And — BANG!!!
CLOSEUP
Pasty KEVIN O’MALLEY is face-to-face with him! Kevin's eyes 
are wild, his skin bloated and blue.
Mike SCREAMS, startled.
Kevin gazes crazily, his mouth a pinched grimace.
MIKE
Kevin... ?
(trembling)
Kevin O'Malley??
Kevin stares, unspeaking. His breathing a HORRIBLE WHEEZE.
then... he slowly lifts his head. Revealing his THROAT IS 
SLICED OPEN, ear to ear.
His bloody windpipe is visible, raspy. Kevin’s mouth opens 
and shuts, puppetlike, but only a moist gurgle comes out.
Mike recoils, terrifie
