BACKGROUND_EDIT: "Ordinary dusk, soft glow from recent sun, trees and grass shimmering, crickets chirping, leaves rustling."

::SCRIPT::
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: It is an ordinary dusk of normal quiet and shadow. The gray sky contains a soft glow from the recent sun, so that trees and long blades of grass seem to shimmer in the gathering night. There is a rasp of crickets, and the rustle of leaves in an occasional whispering breeze. Transitions are easy and gradual, with relaxed studies of earth, grass and leafy branches on a high-mounded hill. Revelation of cemetery markers does nothing to disrupt the peacefulness of our established mood; when awareness comes, it is almost as though we have known where we were all along. We are in a typical rural cemetery, conceivably adjacent to a small church ... Although the presence of a church is felt rather than confirmed. The stones range from small identifying slates to monuments of careful design…an occasional Franciscan Crucifix, or a carved image of a defending angel. Over a hundred years of death indicated in stones syllabic with their year and the status of the families they represent.
  EXPRESSION: null
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Over the other night sounds is added the gravel-rumble of a slow-moving car. A wider shot reveals the car and the mounded cemetery, as the car pulls into the gate and moves down one of the cemetery roads, the car passes in extreme foreground and moves away from the camera. In the breeze of its passing, the dead leaves that clutter the little road swirl and move. Beyond the distant trees, the last receding gray of dusk in surrendering to the black. The car continues. When the car stops, we feel the absence of its sounds…replaced by the crickets and the subtle wind.
  EXPRESSION: null
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Even as the car is still rocking slightly form its stopping action, we cut to a shot through the driver window at the occupants of the car. The DRIVER is a young man in his mid-twenties, and his PASSENGER is a young woman, his sister. The man is in shirtsleeves with a loosened tie. His suit-coat is on the clothing hook over the back seat. The girl is wearing a simple but attractive summer suit, with the jacket removed and folded on her lap. She is fussing with her purse, while the man shuts off engine, lights, and leans back to yawn and stretch his legs. The girl closes a potato chip bag, brushes crumbs, fluffs her hair ... typical feminine gestures after a long ride. The man stretches again.

She is near the place where the paths meet, and so is the old man. We cut close to her. She is looking down in embarrassed silence, aware of her proximity with the old man.

Her screams turn to frenzied gasps as she finds a tree limb and snatches it up. But when she looks up, she sees that one has vanquished the other. She stops in her tracks. Night sounds.

The driver’s window is open, she struggles to roll it up ... then pushes the lock button. The man is upon the car. Barbara dives across the seat to slam down the passenger-side lock button. The man rips at the door handles and pounds violently at the car. The girl starts screaming again. The man.. Pounding.. Clawing ... he grabs a stone from the road ... the passenger window shatters into thousands of little cracks.

He roots through it, pulls out a large knife and, sucking his breath in, stuffs it under his belt. Then he reaches into the drawer again and produces another knife. Taking Barbara by surprise, he strides toward her. He shoves the knife at her, handle first, but she falls back slightly.

His search is not without control; it has a coordinated purpose; it is selective, although frantic and desperate. He looks for nails and strips of wood or planks that he might nail around doors and windows. His actions are hurried, and intent after these defensive ends. At first, his search has his full attention. Gradually, as he moves about, and begins to come up with several key items that he needs, his efforts pace down into a more deliberate flow ... he starts putting up boards and tables against the vulnerable parts of the old house.

The noise of the search is ever-present. The man mutters occasionally, and spills his findings about the room. At first, as new cabinets and drawers fail to turn up what he is looking for, he grows impatient and more violent ... spools of thread, buttons, manicure implements, shoe-shine materials ...

  LINE: On a table is a bowl of large, rounded flowers ... a breeze causes them to stir in sync with a sound from the kitchen. The effect startles the girl; she dives for a table lamp, clicks it on, and dull illumination fills the room. The room is empty. She starts slowly toward the fireplace. Near it, is a stack of logwood, and a few planks that might be large enough to nail across the windows. Still clutching her knife, she bends over the pile and gathers up the planking. She stands with her awkward load, and the foreboding room faces her again, stopping her. She bolts and hurries toward the kitchen.
  EXPRESSION: Startled
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Bursting through the door, she finds the big man pounding with his jack-handle at the hinges on a tall broom-closet door. One final swipe and a great yank frees the wooden door, and the man stands it against the wall next to the broom-closet. In the recesses of the closet, the man spots other useful items and pulls them out ... an ironing board, three center boards from a dining table, and some old scrap lumber.
  EXPRESSION:null
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He motions for Barbara to follow, as he grabs the closet door and moves to the back door of the house, which he had previously bolted against the beings outside. He slaps the closet door up against the paned portion of the kitchen door and finds that with this same piece he can cover the kitchen window. He leans against the piece of wood and gropes in his pocket for nails. The door starts to slip slightly; it does not completely cover the adjoining window, but it leaves slots of glass at the top and bottom: however, it does cover the glass part of the entrance door. Barbara drops her burden and moves swiftly, helping the man by holding an end of the barrier in position. The truck-driver accepts her help automatically, without recognition, and gives the barricade a cursory inspection as he determines where to sink the nails. Pulling several nails from his pocket, he places them and drives them in with his jack-handle. He drives two on his through the door and molding until they grab, then moves to her side and drives two more. When four are in, he whacks at them with the jack-handle until they are completely sunken, then begins to add more. Now he starts to talk. The first decisive steps are taken. Quite a lot of relief comes with it. Most of the house is still vulnerable, but the measures taken instill confidence. While he talks, though, he keeps working rapidly, his pace as intense as ever ...

He is forced to grab her again, and practically slam her into a corner. He brings up one powerful fist and punches the girl ... but her head recoils and the blow is misplaced, it does not put her out of commission. But it shocks her into dumb, wounded silence. He hits her again, squarely.. her eyes fall sorrowfully on his and she begins to crumple ... she falls limp against him, as he supports her weight, easing her into his arms.

  LINE: With charcoal-light, he drenches the padded armchair and touches it with a torch. It catches instantly, and flames lick and climb, casting flickering light throughout the house. The heat on the man is severe, but he has to fight it.
  EXPRESSION: Dangerous
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He lunges for the door, unbolting it, and flinging it wide open. From the yard, as the door bangs open, the flaming chair is visible. It throws eerie, irregular illumination onto the lawn. The waiting figures step back slightly.
  EXPRESSION: Aggressive
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: The man shoves the chair through the doorway, it slides across the front porch. It topples over the edge, and the flaming bulk tumbles down the steps onto the front lawn. In the rolling motion, flames lick and fly, and small particles of the chair’s stuffing leap and glow in the night wind. The bonfire rages in the tall grass. The waiting figures back further away.
  EXPRESSION: Dramatic

  EXPRESSION: Resigned

  LINE: The truck-driver boards up the two side windows, then moves to the front door. He gets an ironing board, and places it across the door horizontally. It extends over the flanking glass panels leaving cracks at the top and bottom, but they are to small for anything to get through. He drives nails through the board into the molding and tests the barricade for strength. Finding it sufficient, he leaves it and goes on to the next.
  EXPRESSION: Diligent
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: In the dining-room there are two closed doors. He tries one, finds it locked, examines it and finds no latch. It has been apparently locked with a skeleton key. The other door is locked and leads into a den, which contains several windows. The man is disappointed at the added vulnerability. He thinks for a moment, then leaves the room, shutting the door behind him. It is clear that he has decided to board up the door rather than try to secure the bay windows.
  EXPRESSION: Frustrated
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He checks his remaining lumber. The supply is dwindling, but he selects the best piece for boarding the den door. He is about to start hammering when an idea strikes him. He opens the door again and enters the room. There are chairs, a desk, a bureau ... he steps to the desk and starts to rummage through the drawers. He pulls out paper, a stack of pencils and pens, a compass, a hundred little odds and ends. Another drawer ... A hundred more things ... he leaves it open.
  EXPRESSION: Inspired
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: The bureau contains mostly clothing, he rips out the big drawers and hurls them through the doorway and into the dining area. One drawer ... two ... their contents spilling onto the floor ... he looks back at the bureau ... a final idea hits him. He shoves the great piece of furniture through the door, walking it through the tight opening until it clears the doorway. Then the desk, which warrants another struggle, as the man attempts to secure all things of possible value before he finally nails the door shut.
  EXPRESSION: Determined
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: In the closet, there is a lot of old clothing; the man finds a good warm coat and jacket and flings them over his shoulder. High on the shelves are piles of old boxes, suitcases, hatboxes, and old umbrella. He looks for an instant, debating their worth, or the possible worth of what they might contain. At his feet, he sees still more clutter, boxes, umbre

The barrier is being strained, no doubt about that, but it is holding well enough. The man smashes with the rifle butt against the ugly extremities, pounding ... once, twice.

Eyewitness accounts have been investigated and documented. Corpses of vanquished aggressors are presently being examined by medical pathologists, but autopsy efforts have been hampered by the mutilated condition of these corpses. Security measures instituted in metropolitan areas include enforced curfews and safety patrols by armed personnel. Citizens are urged to remain in their homes. Those who ignore this warning expose themselves to intense danger from the aggressors themselves, and from armed citizenry ... whose impulse may be to shoot first and ask questions later.

  LINE: Rural or otherwise-isolated dwellings have most frequently been the objective of frenzied, concerted attack. Isolated families are in extreme danger. Escape attempts should be made in heavily-armed groups, and by motor vehicle if possible. Appraise your situation carefully before deciding upon an escape tactic. Fire is an effective weapon. These beings are highly flammable. Escape groups should strike out for the nearest urban community. Manned defense outpost have been established on major arteries leading into all communities. These outposts are equipped to defend refugees and to offer medical and surgical assistance. Police and vigilante groups are in the process of combing remote areas in search and destroy missions against all aggressors. These patrols are attempting to evacuate isolated families. But rescue efforts are proceeding slowly, due to the increased danger of nightfall and the sheer enormity of the task. Rescue, for those in isolated circumstances, is highly undependable. You should not wait for a rescue party unless there is no possibility of escape. If you are few against many, you will almost certainly be overcome. The aggressors are irrational and demented. Their sole urge is the quest for human flesh. Sheriff Conan W. McClelland, of the county department of public protection, was interviewed minutes after he and his vigilante patrol had vanquished several of the aggressors. We bring you now the results of that interview.

Some of the men smoke, some talk in groups. The area is illumined by a large bonfire. Sheriff McClelland is the focal figure, MCU, so that as he talks we catch glimpses of activity in the background. He is shouting commands, supervising defense measures and the burning of the bodies, at the same time trying to answer reporter’s questions. We cut or zoom closer. McClelland is pacing around, not straying too far, because a lavaliere microphone is hanging on a cord around his neck. The crackle of the bonfire, the shouts and the bustle of activity can be constantly heard behind his commentary. As he talks, he frequently turns away, his primary concern being his efforts in dealing with the aggressors and controlling his search party.
