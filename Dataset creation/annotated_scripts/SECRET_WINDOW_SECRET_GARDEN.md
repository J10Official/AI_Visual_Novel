- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: A guy's tortured face.
  EXPRESSION: Sad
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: MORT RAINEY sits in the driver's seat of his car, knuckles white on the wheel. Frozen. His face is wet with tears.
  EXPRESSION: Distraught
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He wipes his cheeks in irritation, puts the car in gear and steps on the gas, pulling out of the parking lot he's been parked in. We roll with him, still staring at his face as he hauls around a corner and out onto the road, into a mid-winter snow storm, just after dawn.
  EXPRESSION: null
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Suddenly he curses, double-toots the brakes, steps abruptly in the middle of the road, sits there for a moment —- and puts the car in reverse.
  EXPRESSION: Frustrated
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He backs right back into the parking lot, back to the very spot he was before, where he comes to a stop. He freezes with his hand on the gear shift — then puts it in park and climbs out of the car, leaving the door hanging open, the car BINGING at him about the keys, the lights, you're doing everything wrong.
  EXPRESSION: Annoyed
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Mort walks across the parking lot -- still doesn't want to go, still can't stop. He's headed for the doors of a strip motel, the kind where you park your car in front of your room, a twelve-cabins-twelve-vacancies kind of place.
  EXPRESSION: Reluctant
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He walks straight toward door number 6, the only door with a car parked in front of it. Two cars, as a matter of fact. He walks right between them, up to the door of the room, and tries the handle softly. Locked, of course.
  EXPRESSION: Determined
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He thinks for a moment, then turns and walks off to the left. We stay where we are, watch as he walks toward the lighted motel office at the end of the row. Mort goes inside, the door JINGLES, we see through the window as he walks behind the unattended front counter. He takes something off the wall, turns and walks back out, holding a key.
  EXPRESSION: Cunning
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Just as he leaves, we see a MANAGER in a tee shirt come out from the back room, looking around to see what happened.
  EXPRESSION: Suspicious
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: He figures it out and takes off after Mort, but by that time Mort is already back at the door to number 6 again. He slides the key into the lock, turns the handle and shoves the door open, harder than he intended to.

  EXPRESSION: Shocked

  LINE: There's so much noise and jumping around there's no point writing down the dialogue, because we can’t make out more than a word or two of it anyway. But all the words have been shouted before verbatim, and by the way Mort is yelling at the Naked Woman and the Naked Man is screaming at Mort to calm down we can tell who got fucked over and who did the fucking.

  EXPRESSION: Unfinished

  LINE: The cursor blinks accusingly at the tail of that unfinished thought, the rest of the screen is blank. There's a beat up old leather chair near the desk and a small dog asleep in it — BUMP, a friendly old spaniel with a graying muzzle. We turn, look through the open door of the study and race into the living room, where the writer of the unfinished story is also asleep, on the couch.

  EXPRESSION: Intense

  EXPRESSION: Shocked

Deciding what the hell, he reaches over and jams the cord into the back of the phone -- which RINGS immediately. Mort twitches. He’s jumpy anyway, but you know, you hate it when that happens.

  EXPRESSION: Shocked
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: Mort's head snaps to get the bad news from the back seat, Ken Kelsch is back there, a hatchet planted in the top of his head. His eyes are open. Brains have trickled down around his ears and dried. Written along the hatchet's handle in faded but still legible red letters is one word — RAINEY.
  EXPRESSION: Traumatized

  EXPRESSION: Ominous

  LINE: FROM MORT'S POINT OF VIEW the world divides into dozens of neat rectangular bores, dozens of identical images of the squirrel on the tree, then the images start to move, to tilt up, it's sky, than it’s the scout, then it's the ground, we realize Mort is falling --

It’s page 63 of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, lying right where Mort dumped it after he cut it out of his own magazine. It's a short story: SOWING SEASON. Short fiction by Norton Rainey. That’s weird. Amy doesn’t like it. She lets go of the page, it flaps away in the light breeze. Now she really takes in the view of the cabin, and there are a few more details that aren’t quite the way we’ve been seeing them. The screen door, for example, which is hanging from one broken hinge. And a single shoe sitting on the front step of the cabin, must go with the sock in the driveway. Amy passes the garbage cabinet and hears flies BUZZIKG. She looks over at the spot where Bump had been pinned to the wood. No Bump, of course, Mort did bury her, but the wood is stained, big dark red chunks of dog stuck to it, fliss feeding on it.

Half-eaten "meals" are on plates around the room, the flies are feasting on these too. The ashtray with the dog on it is buried in the wall, where it has started a small creek, about a foot long. The trash can is full and has overflowed onto the floor. Paper is littered everywhere. It looks as if Mort has exhumed every copy of every manuscript he had in the place and strewn the pages around, the room. In short, the room looks nothing like it did two minutes ago, when we were looking at it through Mort's eyes. But as we now know, those are very unreliable eyes indeed. Worst of all, everywhere, everywhere is one word. The word is SHOOTER. It's written on the walls in chalk and ink, it's sprayed on the window twice in what looks like dried whipped cream — and there‘s the Redi-Whip can on the floor under the window to prove it. "Shooter" is written on the stair railings in pencil, neat columns stacked on top of each other like addition problems. It's even carved into the cherry wood coffee table in great jagged letters three feet high, like a grotesque declaration of love — SHOOTER. The screwdriver he used to do the carving is lying on the tabletop. It's a familiar-looking screwdriver, with a red chipped handle, and dried red stuff on its steel shaft. We've seen this screwdriver before. Twice.
