FADE IN :EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY1 1A dull highway. A crappy sedan roars by.INT. CRAPPY CAR - DAY2 2At the wheel, driving this piece of shit, is MIKE ENSLIN, 35, a grizzled, weary soul. He stares glassily at the road, a cigarette behind his ear, a styrofoam cup of Exxon coffee at his mouth.A sign drifts by: "Woodfin, Rte 251 N - Asheville, Interstate 240 E, Hwy 40, Next Right, Thru Traffic Merge”Heh? Mike frowns.EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK3 3RAIN pours down on an unpaved country intersection.Mike stands outside his car, soaked, checking a wet map. He’s confused and annoyed. There are no road markings at all. He checks his watch.EXT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT4 4A quaint rural inn, dark of night. The ambiance is picturesque, but off-putting. Porch lanterns glow. Shadows are deep. An ancient elm tree frames the banging weathered-sign: "The Camden Inn"Then, finally — headlights. Mike’s car pulls up in the mud.

INNKEEPERThere’s a picture —MIKECan we do this in the morning?MRS. INNKEEPER(rummaging through drawers)Wait! It's printed in our brochure!INSERT - BROCHUREShe thrusts out a brochure that says "HAUNTED!" There’s a PHOTO of the lobby, and a faint white shape in a window.MRS. INNKEEPERDo you SEE her?MIKEUh —MRS. INNKEEPERA guest took that photo in 1986. You can sort of see Sylvia's "ethereal apparition" reflected in the window.Mike stares, unimpressed.MR.

I’m ready to hit the sack. in your letter, you mentioned the scariest rooms were in the old attic?MRS. INNKEEPERThat's right. The third floor is the former servant's quarters. People say all Sylvia's children died up there of tuberculosis.(spooky)Right up there. Right above where you and I are standing, right now...MR. INNKEEPERGuests have reported strange sounds. At the stroke of midnight, there’s been weird noises. Creaks. Moans.(mysterious)Our best advice... is to lock your door from the inside.CUT TO:INT.
