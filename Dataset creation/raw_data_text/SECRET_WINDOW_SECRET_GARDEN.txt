EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN
1
1
A guy’s tortured face.
MORT RAINEY site in the driver's seat of his car, knuckles 
white on the wheel. Frozen. His face is wet with tears.
He wipes his cheeks in irritation, puts the car in gear and 
steps on the gas, pulling out of the parking lot he's been 
parked in. We roll with him, still staring at his face as he 
hauls around a corner and out onto the road, into a mid-
winter snow storm, just after dawn.
Suddenly he CURSES, double-toots the brakes, steps abruptly 
in the middle of the road, sit there for a moment —-
— and puts the car in reverse. He backs right back into the 
parking lot, back to the very spot he was before, where he 
comes to a stop. He freezes with his hand on the gear shift —
— then puts it in park and climbs out of the car, leaving the 
door hanging open, the car BINGING at him about the keys, the 
lights, you're doing everything wrong.
Mort walks across the parking lot -- still doesn't want to 
go, still can't stop. He's headed for the doors of a strip 
motel, the kind where you park your ear in front of your 
room, a twelve­ cabins-twelve-vacancies kind of place.
He walks straight toward door number 6, the only door with a 
car parked in front of it. Two cars, as a matter of fact. He 
walks right between then, up to the door of the room, and 
tries the handle softly. Locked, of course.
Ha thinks for a moment, then turns and walks off to the left. 
We stay where we are, watch as he walks toward the lighted 
motel office at the end of the row. Mort goes inside, the 
door JINGLES, we see through the window as he walks behind 
the unattended front counter. He takes something off the 
wall, turns end walks back out, holding a key.
Just as he leaves, we see a MANAGER in a tee shirt come out 
from the back room, looking around to see what happened.
He figures it out and takes off after Mort, but by that time 
Mort is already back at the door to number 6 again. He slides 
the key into the lock, turns the handle and shoves the door 
open, harder than he intended to.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

2.
The door BANGS off the cheap drywall, and as the morning 
light spills into the room we get a look at the instrument of 
Mort’s torture.
We can't be sure, of course, but it's a pretty good bet it's 
the NAKED COUPLE asleep in the twisted, love stained sheets. 
Well, they were asleep, now they're awake and all hell breaks 
loose.
They're horrified, shocked and caught and humiliated.
There's so much noise and jumping around there's no point 
writing down the dialogue, because we can’t make out more 
than a word or two of it anyway. But all the words have been 
shouted before verbatim, and by the way Mort is yelling at 
the Naked Woman and the Naked Man is screaming at Mort to 
calm down we can tell who got fucked over and who did the 
fucking.
And now the Motel Manager arrives and jumps into the mix, 
SHOUTING and waving just like the others. God what a mess.
It’s sweaty and ugly and painful, so we pull back the way we 
came, out the door of the roof, back into the snow-driven 
parking lot, leaving them to themselves.
Another couple walks past the room, the WOMAN slows down, 
strains for a look at the wreck, the GUY pulls her along, are 
you crazy?
The door SLAMS shut in our faces.
Into some rooms you should never look.
CUT TO:
EXT. TASHMORE LAKE - DAY

Dark shapes slither under the glassy surface of a mountain 
lake. We fly over the lake, thinking the shapes are fish, but 
they're too big, too long and scary and twisted for lake 
fish. Maybe they're not really there.
Six Month Later
We fly toward a house at the edge of the lake, a nice little 
cabin, somebody built for themselves. Winter's over, it's a 
beautiful spring day and the windows are open, so we glide 
through one of them.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY

3.
Inside the house, we're in a study, the room with the best 
view, its walls lined with hooks and bound periodicals. The 
desk is piled high with crap, this guy's not a filer. There's 
a computer on the desk, bomb words on the screen, we nose 
close enough to read them.
Four days after George had confirmed to his own satisfaction 
that his wife was cheating on him, he confronted her. "I have 
to talk to you, Abby," he said.
The cursor blinks accusingly at the tail of that unfinished 
thought, the rest of the screen is blank. There's a beat up 
old leather chair near the desk and a small dog asleep in it 
— BUMP, a friendly old spaniel with a graying muzzle. We 
turn, lock through the open door of the study and ace into 
the living room, where the writer of the unfinished story is 
also asleep, on the couch.
Mort's put on about six years in the past six months, and the 
overlong midday nap he’s buried in doesn't help. Yeah, 
there's dried drool.
A KNOCK on the front doer gets no response from Mort but it 
draws our attention. Approaching the door, we see a DARK 
FIGURE move to the window next to the door. The drapes are 
drawn so we just see a silhouette as the figure tries to peer 
through the window. Then it moves back to the door.
Another knock, louder now. And than, surprisingly, the 
doorknob turns a few times, stopped by the look. This guy 
wants in.
A third knock, really a pounding, is abruptly cut off as Mort 
jerks the door open, revealing the man on the porch.
EXT. POACH - DAY

JOHN SHOOTER looks about forty-five, very thin, a calm face, 
almost serene, but carved with deep lines. He wears a blue 
work shirt, buttoned all the way to the razor-reddened flesh 
of his neck. Jeans (cuffed), yellow work shoes.
But it’s the hat that catches your attention. It's a big 
black one, a round crown planted squarely on his head, sort 
of like the kind Quakers wore.
Mort stands there, still waking up, only halfway into the 
real world. Shooter speaks first.
SHOOTER
You stole my story.
Mort blinks. Huh?
4.
SHOOTER
You stole my story and something's 
got to be done about it. Right is 
right and fair is fair and 
something has to be done.
Mort opens his mouth, finds nothing to say, and closes it 
again.
SHOOTER
Well?
MORT
(finally)
I --
(no voice, clears his 
throat)
I don't know you.
SHOOTER
I know that. That doesn't matter. I 
know you, Mr. Rainey. That a what 
matters. You stole my story.
He holds out his hand, and it’s got something in it. Mort 
flinches, but it's only a stack of paper, & manuscript.
MORT
I don't read manuscri-
SHOOTER
You read this one already.
(stating a simple tact)
You stole it.
Unnerving. Mort looks out to his long driveway. Nobody else 
there. Nobody around at all, just an extra car parked in his 
driveway, an old station wagon with out of state plates.
MORT
(back to Shooter)
I can assure you-
SHOOTER
I know you can. I know that. I 
don't want to be assured.
MORT
(sounding a bit pompous 
and hating it)
If you want to talk to someone 
about some grievance you feel you 
have, you could call my literary 
agent in­-
5.
SHOOTER
This is between you and me.
Bump the dog limps into the doorway, wagging his tail 
enthusiastically.
SHOOTER
We don’t need any outsiders, Mr, 
Rainey. It is strictly between you 
and me.
MORT
I don't like being accused of 
plagiarism, if that's what you're 
doing.
Bump makes arthritic attempts to befriend Shooter.
MORT
Bump, go inside.
Bump does.
SHOOTER
I don't blame you for not liking 
it. But you did it. You stole my 
story.
MORT
You'll have to leave. I have 
nothing to say to you.
SHOOTER
Yeah, I'll go. We'll talk more 
later.
He holds out the manuscript. Mort's reflexes make him reach 
for it, but he pulls his hand back.
MORT
I'm not taking that.
SHOOTER
Won’t do you any good to play games 
with me, Mr. Rainey. This has got 
to be settled.
MORT
So far as I’m concerned, it is.
He steps beck inside and closes the door.

Mort freezes right next to the door as soon as it's closed. 
He holds his breath and waits for either the knock to come or 
footsteps to trail away. But he hears neither. Shooter is 
just standing there.
Bump sits by the door, staring up at Mort — are we going out 
or staying in?
Finally, there is a soft THUMP, followed by work shoes on 
porch, then work shoes on gravel. Mort goes to the window and 
touches the curtain aside.
Through the window, he sees Shooter crunching across the 
driveway toward his car. From this angle, Mort can make out 
the license plate's state of issue -- Mississippi.
Shooter opens the door, gets behind the wheel, tosses his hat 
on the seat next to him. Ha starts the car, puts it in 
reverse, and backs all the way down the driveway, cut to the 
road.
Mort sighs. That’s over. But then a worrisome thought crosses 
his mind. He looks back at the door.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

Shooter's manuscript sits on the front porch, a rook resting 
on top of the title page to keep it from blowing away. The 
edges of the pages flutter in the wind.
Mort stands on the front porch, barefoot, hands in the 
pockets of his khaki pants, looking down at it. Hard to tell 
how long he's been standing like this, just staring at the 
thing.
He looks up the driveway, makes sure shooter really is gone. 
He squats down next to the manuscript, wants to get a closer 
look but doesn't want to touch it. He picks up the rock, 
tosses it into the bushes.
The title page blows off the stack, blown by the breeze, and 
Mort catches it. He turns it around and reads it.
Secret Window, Secret Garden
by Jobs Shooter
Mort breathes a little sigh of relief.
MORT
Haver heard of you, pal.
He scoops up the rest of the manuscript —

-- and tosses it out in the kitchen trash can.
MORT
Never heard of your story.
He washes his hands in the sink, as if to scrub it off 
himself --

— and flops back down on the couch.
MORT
Now where was I...
He rolls over and resumes his nap.
Bump curls up next to the couch and resumes her nap too.

Mort stares blankly out the window. He's at his desk, in 
front of the computer. Next day, maybe? A clock ticks above 
him. It‘s 10:26. Somewhere upstairs, a VACUUM CLEANER drones.
Cut on the lake, two motorboats leave wide white wakes behind 
them, kids grab-assing, playing chicken.
Those TICKS are too damn loud. Mort looks up at the clock. 
Still 10:26.
He turns and looks at Bump, who is asleep in the leather 
chair next to the desk, apparently her writing spot.
MORT
Why do I have to do all the work?
Bump lifts his head sleepily, looks at Mort. Are we writing?
MORT
I'm open to ideas, here.
Bump puts his head back down. Mart looks back at the computer 
screen. Still that same unfinished sentence.
"I have to talk to you, Abby," is said.
8.
Mort looks back up at the clock. Hey, whaddya know, it's 
10:27. Time flies.
Upstairs, the vacuum cleaner shuts off.
Struck by inspiration, Mort highlights the mini-paragraph he 
has written.
And delates it. Now the whole screen is blank. He locks back 
at Bump.
MORT
Better, right?
Bump sighs. From the other room, Mort hears a series of loud, 
clanking THUMPS as somebody drags the vacuum cleaner 
downstairs. Staring at the blank screen, Mort bobs his head 
in time to the THUMPS -- ka-bump, ka-bump, ka-bump, I'll go 
insane if I sit here much longer.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

In the kitchen, Mort takes a can of Coke out of the fridge 
and knocks it shut with his hip. Ha notices a stack of paper 
on the counter and bends over, not recognizing it. It's 
spotted with orange juice and a few coffee grounds, but the 
title page is still clear:
Secret Window, Secret Garden
by John Shooter
How'd it do that? He threw it out. In the background, MRS. 
GAVIN, the cleaning lady, brings the canister vacuum to a 
crash-landing on the living room floor, visible through the 
open door.
Mrs. Gavin treats Mort with the overly kind, somewhat 
irritating concern one gives a victim of a terminal disease.
MRS. GAVIN
I found one of your stories in the 
trash, Mr. Rainey. I thought you 
might want it, so I put it on the 
counter.
MORT
I see that.
Curious, ha turns over the title page and picks up the 
manuscript. As he reads the first few sentences, we creep 
closer to his face and hear his inner voice:
9.
MORT (V.O.)
Todd Downey thought that a woman 
who would steal your love when your 
love was really all you had was not 
much of a woman.
Mort’s brow furrows. His voice reads on.
MORT (V.O.)
He therefore decided to kill her. 
He would do it in the deep corner 
formed where the house and barn 
came together at an extreme angle.
A look approaching panic crosses Mort's face.
MORT (V.O.) (COST'D)
He would do it where his wife kept 
her garden, the garden she loved 
more than she loved his.
Mort's arm twitches out away from him, almost involuntarily -
-
MORT (CANT'D)
Oh shit.
— and he slams the manuscript back down on the counter, just 
to get it away from him, knocking over his can of Coke in the 
process.
MORT
Oh SHIT!
Mrs. Gavin comes in a hurry, surveys the situation, sees that 
it's just spilled Coke, and grabs a towel.
MRS. GAVIN
Thank God. Prom the sound of you I 
thought you’d cut your own throat! 
Let as get this, that's my job.
MORT
I’m sorry, I--
He moves out of the way, and the first thing she does is pick 
up the manuscript and put it back in his hands. Mort looks 
down at the fucking thing in irritation, can’t get away from 
it. Now it’s stained with Coke too.
MRS. GAVIN
10.
I'll take care of this, Mr. Rainey, 
you go on back to work. Everybody’s 
waiting for your next opus, me 
included.
MORT
I didn't write this.
MRS. GAVIN
(moving to the sink)
'Scuse.
MORT
It's not mine.
MRS. GAVIN
Oh. I thought it was.
MORT
No, it says John Shooter. Right 
here. See?
He holds up the title page and she favors it with a polite, 
slightly confused glance.
MRS. GAVIN
Ah hah. Thought it was one of those 
whatchacallums. Pseudonames. Or 
Nyms.
MORT
I don't use one. I never have.
MRS. GAVIN
I can't imagine why you would. If I 
could write stories like you I 
wouldn’t hide behind some made up 
name, that's for sure.
MORT
Somebody else wrote this story.
MRS. GAVIN
Okey dokey then.
She bends down to clean up the soda on the floor,
Mort looks at the story, still in his hands. He's afraid of 
it.
CUT TO:
EXT. STUDY - DAY

11.
A chair BANGS down on the floor of the study, next to the 
book case wall.
CLOSE ON the spine of a book on a top shelf — "Everybody 
Drops the Dime,“ the author's last name is Rainey. A hand 
grabs it.
The book THUNKS down on the desk, turns toward us. Full 
author’s name on the front cover -- Morton Rainey. Plus the 
word "Stories."
Mort's finger skims the table of contents. About a dozen 
stories Kara. The finger stops at one called "Sowing Season."
Pages riffle by, stop at the first page of "Sowing Season."
Mort stares down at the page, doesn't bother to wit. Two 
push­ins now, one toward the page, one toward Mort's face as 
he reads it. Again, his inner voice:
MORT (V.O.)
A roman who would steal your love 
when your love was all you had 
wasn't much of a woman — that, at 
least, was Tommy Havelock's 
opinion.
(aloud, a half-whisper)
He decided to kill her.
Mort sage into the chair, still reading.
MORT
Fuck me...
(inner voice again)
He even knew the place he would do 
it, the exact place:
(aloud)
the little patch of garden
(inner voice)
she kept in the extreme angle 
formed where the house and the barn 
came together. The garden she loved 
more than she loved him.
Mort sits forward again, SLAPS Shooter's story down on the 
desk on his left, the book next to it on his right.
He reads. Compares sentences.
Pages flip, middle of the story now. Things are moving 
faster, jumpy.
More pages, near the end, Mort's face is sweaty, he's 
grinding his teeth.
12.
Last page, shit, this got worse and worse, he shoves them 
both away from him and sits back, breathing hard. He stares 
for a moment, shocked still --
-- and then snaps out of it and starts searching the desk, 
almost frantic. Doors rip open, are rifled and slammed shut, 
papers overturned, swept aside. Dig, dig, dig, past junk 
mail, paper clips, cancelled checks, old Doritos. Finally, 
lifting up thick, heavily marked manuscript, he unearths the 
mother lode.
A sun-faded, nearly flattened old pack of L&M's. Mort lets go 
a happy GASP, picks them up and pokes them open.
Three cigarettes are lined up neatly inside, only a little 
squashed.
A match flares, touches the tip, Mort sucks hard and the 
tobacco CRACKLES with age.
Mort sits back in the chair, exhales a cloud around his bead.
A thought is right there in the front of his brain. He turns 
and looks at Bump, gives the thought breath.
MORT
(a touch defensive)
I didn't steal it.
Bump just stares back.
MRS. GAVIN (O.S.)
Mr. Rainey?
Mort looks up, startled. Mrs. Gavin is in the doorway, jacket 
on, purse in hand. Mort darts the cigarette hand down below 
the desk so she doesn't see.
MRS. GAVIN
I'm all done.
MORT
Okay, thanks. Thanks a lot. See you 
next time.
He looks back down, hoping she'll leave, but she stays there 
for a moment. She SNIFFS the air lightly, then looks at him 
with big sad eyes.
She SIGHS and he looks back up.
MRS. GAVIN
Mr. Rainey, I just want to say-
13.
MORT
(no, please don't)
Oh...
MRS. GAVIN
Sone women don’t know a good thing 
when they get it. Soon women don't 
know they got the whole world when 
it's right in front of their nose. 
There, that's it, not another word 
from me. Would you like me to make 
you something to eat?
MORT
Nope, thanks, I'm good, thank you, 
that'll do it, see you next time, 
thanks.
MRS. GAVIN
You‘re a good man, Mr. Rainey.
She sniffs once more, shakes her head sympathetically, and 
leaves. Immediately, Mort brings the cigarette back up end 
takes another deep drag. He looks down at the two stories an 
his desk. Back over at Bump, who is staring at him 
accusingly.
MORT
I didn't steal it.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
14
14
BANG! The door from the study smacks open. Mort staggers into 
the living room, dizzy from the smoke, sucking the cigarette 
haze in here with him. He starts for the kitchen, spots the 
couch —
— and swerves in mid-stride right toward it. He barks his 
shin on the coffee table on the way, CURSES under his breath, 
strips his bulky wristwatch off his wrist, dumps it on the 
table and collapses onto the couch, into It, almost, as if 
its gravity is three times that of the rest of the planet. It 
pulls him right down into its deepest recesses, his face 
buries in pillow.
Bump harumphs to the floor in front of the fireplace, always 
game for a nap. Mort catches eyes with him.
MORT
Did I?
And his eyes roll back into his bead as sleep sucks him in.
14.
CUT TO BLACK.
IN THE TOTAL BLACK
we hear a man walking, scraping his way through hard, rustly 
stalks of something. He's in a —
EXT. CORK FIELD - DAY
16
16
-- corn field, and the person walking is Mort. He seems lost 
among the tall rows of corn, can't find his bearings. He 
feels something sharp and locks down at his arm. A line of 
blood traces through the torn sleeve of his shirt. He's 
puzzled.
Wincing, he looks down at his ether arm. The sharp corn 
tassles are scraping him, another line of blood traces 
through his left sleeve as he looks. He shoves the sleeve up, 
revealing not just one but a half a dozen watches on his 
wrist, and every one shows a different time.
Ahead of him, the corn on both sides of the row shakes and 
rustles. AMY RAINEY, mid-thirties, the female half of the 
naked couple from the opening, steps out from one side.
John Shooter steps out from the other. Both of then hold 
knives.
SHOOTER
I’m confident I can take care of 
this business.
They walk toward him.
SHOOTER
I’m sure that, in time, your death 
will be a mystery.
AMY
Even to us.
Mort turns to run, but a hand, Amy's hand, reaches out and 
grabs him by the belt. He falls to the ground, sees only dirt 
and dark down here at the bottom of the stalks, but then 
there's something bright, brilliant-bright, it's a knife.
Shooter hands it to Amy, he grabs Mort's face roughly and 
forces open his right eye. Any raises the knife, Mort 
SCREAMS, the knife flashes across his eyeball and just as 
suddenly as everything went black it suddenly flashes -­
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

15.
— white and loud, really loud, a bell ringing, like a glass 
bell, on and on and it won't stop. Mort's eyes pop open wide 
and he sucks in his breath and now he's bathed in sweat and 
panic and has no idea where he is or how much time has 
passed, but the reason for the sweat and the bright is easy 
enough, it's the blinding midday sun, pulverizing his face 
through the big living room windows. The ringing stops.
Mort sits up, looks a wreck. The ring again, but this time a 
regular ring, a telephone. Ha answers.
MORT
(nap voice)
'lo?
AMY (O.S.)
Hello, Mort.
Mort freezes, and that visible blanche combined with the 
woman’s voice should tell us it's the ex.
AMY (O.S.)
Hello?
MORT
Yeah.
AMY (O.S.)
Are yon all right?
MORT
Of course I'm all right. Why 
wouldn’t I be all right?
INT. AMY’S KITCHEN - DAY

Close on Amy Rainey’s face. She's sitting at the table in bar 
kitchen, a cordless phone pressed to het ear. She's tense, 
not an enjoyable call for her either.
AMY
I don’t know, I -- it's just, 
you're alone up there, anything 
could happen and nobody would knew.
MORT (O.S.)
I‘d know.
AMY

An awkward pause. Mort wipes his forehead. Looks at his hand, 
it's dripping sweat. He softens his tone.
MORT

Hey, what's up with the roof? Did 
Greg Carstairs ever get off his ass 
and­ --
MORT
Why’d you call, Amy?
INT. AMY’S KITCHEN - DAY

Further back from her now, seeing the whole kitchen. It’s 
nice, this is an expensive house someplace. Amy's on the 
phone in the background. In the foreground, a few pictures 
hang on a wall. Weird spaces in the picture wall, some have 
been taken down recently and there hasn't been enough now 
living yet to fill the spaces.
AMY
Cut past the bullshit, huh?
He answer. She gets up and walks toward us.
AMY
I had one of those feelings I get. 
I know you think they’re stupid and 
you don't believe them but I 
believe them, and I had -- I was 
making a sandwich and I got this 
sensation that you... that you 
might not be okay. I held off for a 
while, I thought it’d go away, but 
it didn’t.
(leans in the door jam)
So here I am.

He picks his watch up off the coffee table and looks at it 
idly. It's one thirty.
MORT
Right. Well. I don't know what to 
tell you, 'cept I'm fine.
17.
AMY (O.S.)
And nothing weird happened or 
anything?
Mort flips the watch over in his hand, looks at the back 
side. There's an engraving there — "I Love You, Amy.“
He hesitates. Well, something weird did happen, but she's 
kinda the last parson he wants to tell about it. Still...
MORT
Do you remember “Sowing Season?"
AMY (O.S.)
Huh?
MORT
My story. The one where the guy-
AMY (O.S.)
I remember. Not one of my 
favorites.
MORT
Good to know.
AMY (O.S)
Well, it was kinda hostile, don’t 
you think?
MORT
You know, I so miss your 
constructive criticism.
AMY (O.S.)
(this is headed south)
What about the story?
MORT
Do you remember me writing it? I 
mean, do you think it's possible 
that I was... influenced by 
anybody, or anything in particular 
while I was doing it?
INT. AMY’S HOUSE - DAY

Even further back, down a long hall with ample rooms on 
either aide. This is a nice house, Amy's still coming toward 
us.
AMY
Other than Maker's Mark?

MORT (O.S.)
Yeah, I know, that's why I can't 
remember, I was still drinking 
then.
AMY
(glances at a clock on 
the wall)
I don't know. Lemme see. You got 
weird on that one, wrote it mostly 
at night, I think. You'd thrash 
around and thus get up and work on 
it till breakfast.
She reaches a window at the front of the house, bends down 
and looks outside.
AMY
What do you man "influenced?“

it, don't do it)
How's Ted?
AMY (O.S.)
He's fine.
MORT
Me and him should have a drink some 
time, we’ve been to a lot of the 
same places.
Sing. Pause.
AMY (O.S.)
What was that for, me saying I 
didn't like your story?
MORT
I gotta go.
AMY
So do I.
But nobody hangs up. Mort chews his lip, doesn’t want to ask 
something, can't help it.
MORT
He’s there, isn’t he.
AMY (O.S.)
No. We’re not together.
Hope crosses Mort’s face and gives the game away -- he still 
wants bar back.
MORT
You're not?
AMY (O.S.)
Uh uh.
MORT
I see.
(pause, trying to keep 
the elation out of his 
voice)
Wall, I'd be lying if I said I was 
sorry to hear that.
INT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

20.
Any looks confused for a moment, then realizes the conclusion 
Mort has drawn and winces.
AMY
No, Mort, what I meant was... I 
want we're not together at the 
moment. He's coming over later.
INT. CABIN - DAY
24
24
Mort blinks. Feels like an asshole, which makes him angry 
again.
AMY (O.S.)
(defensive)
He hardly ever comes here. I go to 
his place.
MORT
Cool. Thanks for sharing.
AMY (O.S.)
Well, don't ask then, it was 
working just fine that way.
EXT. AMY’S HOUSE - DAY
25
25
On the sidewalk now, in front of Amy’s house, a beautiful old 
Victorian in Riverdale. She’s visible in an upstairs window, 
checking outside again. The conversation continues as a 
purply BMW pulls up into the foreground.
MORT (O.S.)
Yon should have him over more. It's 
a nice house. I like it. I love it, 
that's why I bought it.
A man gets out of the car. TED, the male half of the naked 
couple, gets out and heads toward the house, waving to the 
upstairs window.
INT. AMY’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
27
27
Amy turns away from the window abruptly.
AMY
Goodbye, Mort.
INT. MORT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
28
28
21.
Mort hangs up hard without another word. He grabs at the air 
in intense frustration, why did I do that, why did I fuck it 
up like that, what is the matter with me.
MORT
Fuck fucking stupid stupid...
He grabs a walking stick that's propped in a corner. Snatches 
a heavy shirt off a hook. And the front door SLAMS behind 
him.
In front of the fireplace, Bump lifts his head, mildly 
indignant. You can't go for a walk without me.
CUT TO:
EXT. PATH BY THE LAKE - DAY
29
29
A rock skips two, three, four times across the smooth surface 
of the lake. Mort strides along the lake path, trying to walk 
off the phone call.
He reaches a place where the lakeside path forks. He takes 
the right-hand branch climbing a steep bank back up to the 
road. As he reaches the top, the sun comes out from behind a 
cloud and his own long shadow appears in front of him, 
leading him forward, pointing the way —
— toward the pair of dusty yellow work shoes at the top of 
the hill. John Shooter leans against his old Ford station 
wagon, arms folded across his chest, waiting, as if he knew 
all along Mort would arrive at this spot, at this time.
Mort doesn’t allow himself to stop, but can't help a little 
bitch in his stride. He stops about six feet short of 
Shooter, opens his mouth to speak, but the other man speaks 
first.
SHOOTER
You read it?
Mort stares at him. His fingers tighten on the walking stick.
MORT
I did.
SHOOTER
I imagine it rang a bell, didn't 
it?
MORT
It certainly did. When did you 
write it?
22.
SHOOTER
I thought you'd ask that.
MORT
Wall, sure. That's the whole point, 
isn't it? When two writers show up 
with the same story, it's all about 
who wrote the words first. Wouldn't 
you say that's true?
SHOOTER
I suppose I would. I suppose that's 
why I came all the way up here from 
Mississippi.
A car approaches, a Scout. Mort turns, waves to the driver, 
TOM GREENLEAF, an elderly man in a flannel shirt. Tom waves 
back. Shooter raises a hand slightly, tips a finger in Tom's 
direction in a practiced, country sort of way. Then turns 
calmly back to Mort.
SHOOTER
Now what were we saying?
MORT
We were trying to establish 
provenance. That means--
SHOOTER
I knew what it means. I know I'm 
wearing shitkicker clothes and 
driving a shitkicker car and I come 
from a long line of shitkickers and 
maybe that makes me a shitkicker 
myself, but it doesn't necessarily 
make me a stupid shitkicker.
MORT
Let's cut past the bullshit, okay? 
When did you write the story, Mr. 
Shooter?
SHOOTER
Maybe my name’s not Shooter. Maybe 
that’s just a pen name.
MORT
Well, what's your real one?
SHOOTER
I didn't say it wasn't; I only said 
maybe. Either way, that's not part 
of our business.
23.
He stops, squints up at a cloud, watches it move past the 
sun. Mort follows his gaze, then turns and shakes his head — 
why am I even talking to this guy?
SHOOTER
Seven years ago. 1995.
Mort suppresses the surge of victory that runs through him.
MORT
Why'd you wait so long? My book of 
short stories was published in '96, 
that's six years ago,
SHOOTER
Because I didn't know. Didn't run 
across it till I was on a bus trip 
to Jackson six months ago. Selling 
my dairy fam to a fella up there 
owns a lot of dairy farms in 
Mississippi. Been thinking with a 
little more money, I could write 
days, when my mind's fresh, instead 
of just after dark. Picked your 
book off one of them wire racks in 
the Rexall, just grabbed the first 
book my hand happened on. I read 
the first half a dozen stories the 
way up. I didn't think they were 
any great shakes, but they passed 
the time.
MORT
Thank you.
SHOOTER
(studies him for a 
second)
Wasn't offering you any real 
compliment.
MORT
Yeah, I got that.
SHOOTER
(shrugs)
24.
Anyway, I read two more going 
back... and than that one. My 
story. How'd you get it? That's 
what I really want to know. How in 
hell did a big-money scribbling 
asshole like you get down to a 
little a shitsplat town in 
Mississippi and steal my goddam 
story? I'd like to know why, too, 
unless you stole all the other ones 
as well, but the how of it'll be 
enough to satisfy me right now.
MORT
(pissed off)
Drop it.
SHOOTER
Drop it? Drop it? What in hell do 
you mean, drop it?
MORT
You said you wrote your story in 
1995. I wrote mine in late ’92. It 
was published for the first time in 
June of 1993, in a magazine. Nice 
try, but I beat you by two years, 
Mr. Shooter, or whatever your name 
is. If anybody’s got a bitch about 
plagiarism, it's me.
Shooter moves fact, grabs hold of Mort's upper arms, hard, 
his thumbs really digging in. He spins him around, SLAMS him 
against the car and leans into his face, forehead to 
forehead.
SHOOTER
You lie.
MORT
The fuck I do.
Not one to be pushed around, Mort lunges forward against 
Shooter, sending him stumbling two or three steps backward. 
Shooter tenses, about to rush forward, then forcibly stops 
himself, just stands there, veins bulging with fury.
SHOOTER
Prove it.
MORT
25.
I don't have to prove a thing to 
you, go look for yourself. Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine, June, 
1993.
SHOOTER
And how am I supposed to find that?
MORT
Hell, I'll give you one. It’s at 
my, uh my wife's house in town. 
I've got everything I wrote down 
there.
SHOOTER
“Your wife’s house?" What the hell 
does that mean?
MORT
What do you think, you fucking 
cracker? I'm in the middle of a 
divorce.
Pause. Shooter contemplates strangling Mort to death.
SHOOTER
We keep on this way we're gonna 
have a fight.
MORT
(not fearful, just 
direct})
I don't want that.
SHOOTER
Part of you does. Part of you wants 
just that. You strike as as the 
kinds guy who's on the lookout for 
a head he can knock off with a 
shovel. But what you don’t 
understand is that if we do start 
to fight, it's not gonna end until 
one or the other of us is dead.
MORT
(low and even})
I have had a bad fucking six 
months, pal. Really... try me.
SHOOTER
(studies him)
This other house. The one your wife 
has now. It's downstate?
26.
MORT
None of your business.
SHOOTER
Means yet. She's there now?
MORT
None of your business.
SHOOTER
Means yes.
(thinks)
I’ll give you three day.
MORT
That's very generous of you.
SHOOTER
Don’t you make light of me, son. 
I'm trying my best to hold my 
temper, and doing a pretty good job 
of it, but —
Ha leans over and reaches through the open window of his car. 
Mort tenses and takes a step back.
MORT
What are you doing?
SHOOTER
Just gettin' m' smokes. Hold your 
water.
He pulls his arm put of his car, a red package of Fall Malls 
in his hand. He shakes one out, offers another to Mort.
MORT
I don't smoke.
SHOOTER
(lights up)
Three days. You call your ex and 
get her to send you the magazine 
with your story in it, if there is 
such a magazine. And I'll be back.
MORT
I don’t want to call her.
SHOOTER
’Course you don't. There isn't any 
magazine, is why; I think we both 
know that.
27.
MOB?
If I show it to you, you'll go back 
to wherever the hell you came from 
and leave ma alone? I mean, is this 
even worth it or am I wasting my 
time?
Shooter goes to the door of his car and opens it.
SHOOTER
Right is right and fair is fair. 
The first thing is to get you to a 
place where you see I have really 
got you, and you can't wiggle out 
of this mess the way you've 
probably been wiggling out of the 
messes you've made all your life. 
That's the first thing.
He gets in the car and slams the door.
SHOOTER
The second thing is the real reason 
I come.
MORT
Uh huh. And what's that?
SHOOTER
We'll get to it. Meantime you think 
about what's right and what's fair 
and how things oughta and.
MORT
Okay.
(pause)
You realize you're insane, right?
SHOOTER
You didn't think anybody'd ever 
catch you out, did you?
Bs hits the gas and pulls away, leaving Mort standing alone 
by the edge of the road, enveloped in swirling dirt and dust.
MORT
(shouts after him)
Always a pleasure to meet a reader!
CUT TO:
INT. CABIN - KITCHEN - DAY
32
32
28.
Lunch. A bowl of soup and a can of peanuts. Untouched.
Mort’s sitting at the kitchen table, arms folded on it, 
staring down into the chicken noodle, unmoving. Bump the dog 
sits next to the table, looking at Mort, then at Mort's food, 
then at Mort, then at Mort's food. You done with that?
Finally, Mort turns, looks across the room. At the telephone. 
He stares at that for a while, then looks back into his soup.
MORT
(like a kid)
I don't wanna call her.
He looks up at the clock over the sink. 4:12.
He turns, looks through the open door to the living room. He 
sees the couch. Gazes longingly at the couch, more like.
He turns and looks at Bump, who's staring up at him 
expectantly.
Mort looks back at the phone. Then back at Bump. Bump stands 
up -- we doing something?
MORT
(to Bump)
No, no nap. I give her a call about 
the magazine. Then I write some 
more crap for a couple hours, then 
I get to take a nap. Right?
Bump TURNS and limps toward the door. Obviously not getting 
any food from this joker.
MORT
Seriously, Bump, let's get to work.
Bump reaches the kitchen door and pushes through a doggie 
door at the bottom, headed outside.
MORT
No wonder you're not published.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
32A
32A
In the living room, a phone BANGS down on the coffee table. 
Mort sits on the couch, staring at it.
Looks to his left, to the pillow, which still holds the 
indentation where his head rested during his last nap. Ha 
looks hack at the phono and CLAPS his hands together 
purposefully.
29.
MORT
Right.
He reaches for the phone --
-- and unplugs the cord. He lies back on the couch, settles 
the pillows in their familiar positions, gets then exactly 
right, one light punch in the center for the dent —
— and he lets his head fall slowly onto it aa darkness creeps 
in around the corners of the screen, washing the whole thing 
—
BLACK.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
32B
32B
Nighttime in the cabin. Mort's eyes are still closed and his 
head is drifting, rolling, lolling off the couch, but as he 
and his body reach the edge, there's nothing underneath, no 
floor, just a sheer dropoff that gives way to a rocky path a 
hundred feet below. He loses his balance on the edge of the 
couch and falls, SCREAMING —
— to the floor. Nice way to wake up.
He sits up, looks around, orienting himself. Night fell while 
he was asleep and he's in a darkened house. He climbs back 
onto the couch, turns on a light. Squints at his watch. 
10:26. He's slept for six hours.
MORT
Shit.
He sits back on the couch, rolls his head. He's horribly 
stiff. He notices the phone in front of him, remembers the 
call he's been avoiding.
MORT
Tanned rested and ready.
He picks up the receiver, is momentarily puzzled by the lack 
of dial tone, then remembers he pulled the cord. He gets up 
and goes to pick it up, then freezes.
From this angle, he can see out the front window, to the 
porch.
He's looking at the garbage cabinet, and there's something on 
it. Two somethings, actually, a white something and a dark 
something.
30.
Still not plugging the phone in, he gets up and heads for the 
door.
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
33
33
The porch light coms on. Mort walks out the front door and 
stops dead in his tracks, staring straight ahead.
The white something pinned to the garbage cabinet is an B 1/2 
by 11 sheet of typing paper. A few words are printed on it in 
big, hold, easy to read strokes:
YOU HAVE THREE DAYS.
I AM SOT JOKING.
NO POLICE.
Mort's eyes move slightly to the left, to the other 
something.
The other something is Bump. Mort's dog is pinned to the door 
of the garbage cabinet with a screwdriver. Dead.
MORT
Oh God Oh Jesus!
He whirls around suddenly, adrenalins pouring into his 
bloodstream. He SHOUTS into the darkness.
MORT
WHERE ARE YOU?1
His head swivels, he looks six directions all at once.
MORT
GET OUT HERE, YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
SHOW TOUR FACE, YOU FUCKING COWARD!
Ho response. Mort stands there, hands curled into fists, 
ready for a fight, but the only one willing to engage him is 
a dog that BARKS in the distance.
He turns and looks back at Bump. He's alone, all alone, not 
even a pet anymore.
MORT
Oh no... oh Sump...
31.
He approaches the garbage cabinet, his stomach rolling over 
on him. Cold sweat breaks out on his forehead as he gets 
closer. Bump's head, is cocked far to the left. Her teeth are 
bared and her tongue's hanging out. There's a little blood 
around the blade of the screwdriver at the point where it was 
driven into her ruff.
MORT
Oh God, Bump... I’m so sorry you. 
Oh, Bump.
Mort crumples up the sheet of paper, stuffs it in his back 
pocket, then puts his hand on Bump's chest. The body shifts 
slightly, still hanging on the screwdriver. Mort grimaces, 
thinks he might puck, but needs to finish this.
He closes his other hand around the screwdriver’s chipped red 
handle and pulls it free.
He tosses the screwdriver aside and flips open the doors of 
the garbage cabinet. He tosses the lid off one of the trash 
cans and gently places Bump’s body inside, tears rolling down 
his cheeks. He whispers.
MORT
I'll bury you in the morning, girl.
He gently replaces the garbage can lid, cloaca the door, and 
turns around, peering out into the night. He's out there 
somewhere in the dark.
MORT
I'll get you for this.
(shouting at the top of 
his lungs})
I’LL FUCKING GET YOU FOR THIS!
INT. CABIN - NIGHT
34
34
CLICK! The front door locks, deadbolt turns.
SLAM! Mort closes the bedroom window, turns the lock on top 
of it.
Another CLICK, two of ’em, this time the back door, both 
locks, and for good measure Mort slides a chair up under the 
knob.
Two more windows, the roof access panel, and the house is 
secured.
Mort stands in the middle of the living room, breathing hard.
32.
What was once a refuge doesn't seem so anymore.
CUT TO:
EXT. BACK YARD - DAWN
35
35
Mort is silhouetted against the dawn, digging in the dirt 
patch behind the house, the one where its old and new 
sections come together in an I.
He shovels earth back into a small grave. He finishes, tamps 
it down, and looks out at the lake, into the fiery sun.
He’s sweaty and angry, but calm. He looks down at the shovel 
in his hands, hafts it.
Shooter was right. Mort would clock somebody with a shovel if 
he got the chance, and that somebody is John Shooter.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
36
36
A large badge, painted on a storefront window in town. 
Underneath the badge the words TASHMORE LAKE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE, but we're inside the office, so the letters are 
backwards to us.
DAVE NEWSOME (O.S.)
Bump?! He killed Bump?
Mort sits across the desk from DAVE NEWSOKK, seventy or so, 
wearing jeans and a sheriff’s shirt. Dave works on his 
needlepoint while he talks.
MORT
Last night, maybe around nine, I 
was asleep. He left this.
He slides the note across the desk, the warning that was 
stuck to the cabinet next to Bump. Dave leans over and reads 
it, still doing his needlepoint. He shakes his head.
DAVE NEWSOME
“No police." Anytime somebody goes 
and writes "no police" that's just 
about exactly the time a fella 
needs to get himself over to the 
police.
MORT
33.
That's what I figured. I’ve got a 
detailed description of him, his 
car... I didn't get the license 
plate number, but it's from 
Mississippi.
He slides another piece of paper across the desk to Newsome, 
who doesn't notice, what with the needlepoint and all.
DAVE NEWSOME
Got a sister-in-law in Mississippi.
MORT
Anything you can find out about 
this guy, I'd sure appreciate it.
DAVE NEWSOME
My brother's widow.
MORT
See if he has a violent history, 
let me know what I'm dealing with 
here. Of course, if you could find 
him and talk to him, that’s even 
better.
(sliding it closer)
Here’s that descrip--
DAVE NEWSOME
So you got yourself a member of the 
Crazy Folks tribe.
MORT
(shrugs)
They pop up once in a while. Price 
of selling a few books. Anyway, 
here's that description.
DAVE NEWSOME
Killing a dog isn't like killing a 
man, of course. Not sure if it's 
even a crime, come to think.
MORT
Of course it is! What about animal 
cruelty? Or at least destruction of 
private property.
Newsome stops his needlepoint end rubs his hands in pain.
DAVE NEWSOME
34.
Needlepoint. Can you believe it? 
Doc says it's good for the 
arthritis. I must cut quite an 
intimidating law enforcement 
figure, huh?
MORT
Yeah.
DAVE NEWSOME
(picks up paper and pen)
Now, I'm going to need a 
description...
Mort looks at him and --
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
37
37
-- there's an unexpected cut, to the skyline of Manhattan. 
The camera zips over to a desk, we're in an office. KEM 
KILSLS sits behind the desk, big beefy guy, tattoos under a 
Brooks Brothers shirt, former NYPD twenty years and a couple 
million later.
Brawn and business together.
KELSCH
Did you steal it?
Mort is sitting across from him.
MORT
What? No!
KELSCH
Kind of an amazing coincidence, 
don't you think? The stories being 
so much alike.
MORT
Well, obviously, the guy copied it 
from me. Whose side are you on?
KELSCS
Yours. But I still need to know the 
truth. Which kind of situation is 
this, is he a regular wacko like 
you've had before, in which case I 
can help, or is this something you 
should be talking to your lawyer 
about?
35.
Mort ignores the slight blush that rises in his cheeks, looks 
Ken in the eye.
MORT
This guy is just crazy, Ken. That's 
all it is.
Ken looks at him for a long moment, deciding whether or not 
to believe him.
KELSCH
Okay. What do you want ma to do?
MORT
Help. You handled that other 
lunatic. Made him go away.
Kelsch talks fast and squeezes a stress ball, the polar 
opposite of Dave Newsome.
KELSCH
He wasn't this crazy. That guy was 
just an obsessed reader who 
couldn't tell real life from the 
crap you make up for a living. No 
offense. He didn't have a beef like 
this one. When somebody thinks 
they'va got a legitimate grievance 
it ups the stakes about a hundred 
times. This guy Shooter, did he 
threaten your life.
MORT
Not in to many words.
KELSCH
Well, he did break a law with the 
dog, but it doesn't seam to be a 
very important law in Tashmore 
Lake. Your Sheriff Hayseed must be 
a cat person.
MORT
Call me paranoid, but I don't 
exactly feel safe with an arthritic 
seventy year old local sheriff 
watching my back. Will you help me 
out, Ken?
KELSCH
(checking hit schedule 
book)
36.
Uh... I‘m on a trail-the-tail right 
now but I think she's onto me, I 
was gonna hand it off anyway. 
Christ, I haven't slept in a week. 
I got a corporate loyalty thing I 
gotta be back for on Friday, but I 
could give you a couple days.
He pulls a note pad around and taps a discreet time clock on 
his desk. Tick tick tick, dollar dollar dollar. He picks up 
the description Mort has written out and begins to study it.
MORT
My story came out in a magazine a 
couple years before he wrote his. 
I've got a copy of the original 
magazine at Amy’s house, I'm going 
to stop by and get it on the way 
back upstate.
KELSCH
"Amy’s house?"
Mort looks away. Damn, another person I haven't told yet.
MORT
We split up about six months ago.
KELSCH
Shit. I'm sorry,
MORT
So am I.
KELSCH
Amicable?
MORT
Not at first. Better lately.
KBLSCH
What happened? You finally nail one 
of your groupies at some book 
signing? I'm picturing the Omaha 
Barnes and Noble.
Mort just stares at him levelly. Unamused.
KELSCH
That was a dick thing to say. 
Rotten profession, makes you into 
an insensitive prick, I apologize. 
You were saying?
37.
MORT
It's just proof Shooter wants, so, 
fine, I'll get the magazine and 
shove it in his face if that'll get 
him to leave ma alone. Maybe you 
could come with me when I show it 
to him.
KELSCH
No shit I'm coming with you. And if 
I so much as don't like the way he 
breathes, I got a .38 caliber dick 
I'll buy in his ass.
For the first time in a while, Mort smiles. Feels in good 
hands.
KELSCH
You remember my rate?
MORT
(getting up to leave)
An obscene fortune, right?
KELSCH
Yeah, plus a little for inflation. 
You‘ll see a black Lincoln in the 
driveway tonight when you gut home. 
Don't freak out, it's me, keeping 
an eye on things. Get a good 
night's sleep, you don’t lock so 
hot.
At the door, Mort turns back.
MORT
Ken. That other guy, a couple years 
ago. How'd you scare him off?
KELSCH
(doesn't look np)
You don't wanna know.
MORT
Come on, I might use it in a book 
some time.
KELSCH
(laughs, still doesn't 
look up)
You don't wanna know.
MORT
No, really.
38.
Kelsch finally looks up. He's not laughing any more.
KELSCH
You don't want to know.
CUT TO:
INT. MORT'S CAR - DUSK
41
41
Mort drives up the West Side Highway as the sun sets over the 
Hudson. He sees the exit for Riverdale, just north of the 
city. He takes a deep breath. Flexes his hands on the wheel 
as he steers the car off the highway.
EXT. RIVERDALE STREET - DUSK
42
42
The sky is darkening on a street in suburban Riverdale, Amy's 
neighborhood. Mort's car turns a corner and heads toward us.
INT. MORT'S CAR - DUSK
43
43
Mort reaches out and flicks on the lights. The car creeps to 
a halt across the street from Amy's house. But Mort doesn't 
get out.
He sits there, staring. Changing to his point of view, we see 
what he’s staring at -- a purple BMW, parked in front of his 
house. Her house.
Mort stares at the car. Looks up to the house, sees a couple 
lights on. One is downstairs, night be the living room. The 
other is upstairs. Could be the bedroom. A shadow passes 
behind the window shade in the bedroom. Then another shadow. 
There's two people up there.
Mort stares. The light in the bedroom window flicks out.
Downstairs, one of the lights in the front of the house 
flicks off. Somebody opens the front door -- it's Ted, ready 
to leave. He turns, calls back to Amy.
Mort puts his hand on the gear shift, to get out of there. 
But then he changes his mind, reaches out and flicks off the 
headlights instead. Hunkers down a bit in the seat.
Now the other light in the front of the house flicks off and 
Any comes out with Ted. She's carrying a light bag over one 
shoulder.
39.
Mort watches as Ted opens the passenger door for Any and she 
gets into his car. Ted comes around to the other side, gets 
behind the wheel of his purple BMW, and drives away with 
Mort's wife.
Mort lets his head fall forward till it BANGS softly off the 
steering wheal.

SLAM! Mort parks in the driveway back at his cabin and climbs 
out of the car. It's black-dark, but there's enough of a moon 
that he can see Ken Kelsch's Town Car parked in his driveway, 
just as he said it would be.
Mort walks over to it, feet CRUNCHING on the gravel. As he 
draws close, he sees Kelsch's outline in the driver's seat. 
He's upright, but not moving. In fact, he's slumped against 
the driver's side window.
Mort misses a step; he's thinking what we're thinking.
He walks closer. Kalach's head is listing at an odd angle.
Mort raises a hand to knock on the window, he reaches out 
slowly, doesn't really want to know the result, Kalsch is 
either going to turn and look up at him or he's not, and if 
he doesn't, the shooter problem is a lot bigger than he 
thought. His hand draws closer to the window, closer, it's an 
inch away —
— and Kalsch sits bolt upright and whips his head toward 
Mort, caught in a catnap.
MORT
JESUS!
KETSCH
CHRIST!
They both recoil and laugh too hard, breathe deeply as they 
get over it.
MORT
Scared the shit out of me...
Kelsch gats out of the car, stretches. A little embarrassed.
KELSCH
Sorry about that. This week musta 
finally caught up with me.
40.
MORT
This is very reassuring.
KELSCH
Relax, Hemingway —
(checks his watch)
— I was out ten minutes, swear to 
God. I already checked the place, 
everything's fine. Just waiting for 
you to get back to let you know.
MORT
You sticking around tonight?
KELSCH
Not unless you want no to.
Mort looks over at the house. Looks awfully dark and spooky 
from here. He looks back at Ken.
MORT
(reluctant)
I'm sure it’s fine.
KELSCH
Let's take one more look.
MORT
If you insist.
INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Mort stands in the middle of the living room, looking around. 
The front door hangs open, all the lights are on in the 
place.
Ken's void comes from upstairs, a loft-like area that takes 
up half the house.
KELSCH (O.S.)
No monsters up here!
He comes out of a hallway and starts down the stairs.
MORT
(making fun of himself)
Did you check under my bed?
KELSCH
Even in your toy chest. I’ll be 
back in the minute, start asking 
around in town. Find out who else 
saw your nutjob.
41.
He reaches the bottom, takes his jacket off the banister.
MORT
Tom Greenleaf.
KELSCH
Huh?
MORT
Start by asking Ton Greenleaf, he 
lives in town. I was talking to 
Shooter yesterday on Lake Drive, 
about half a mile north of my 
place. Tom came by in his Scoot. He 
waved at us when he went by, and 
both of us waved back. Tom must 
have gotten a good look at him.
KELSCH
Ton Greenleaf. How do I got a hold 
of him?
MORT
Drop by Bowie's Store around nine, 
that's when he gets his coffee.
KELSCH
(heading for the door)
Got it. Don't worry. Once I find 
out where this Shooter's staying. 
I'll stop in for a little freak-me-
out chat. Use the word "we" a lot. 
”We know what you're doing." “We 
want it to stop." "We're watching 
you." Handy thing about a 
schizophrenic, it's not hard to 
convince 'em there’s a conspiracy.
MORT
Makes you think he's a 
schizophrenic?
KELSCH
Well he ain't what you call normal. 
Trust me, he’ll hit the road so 
hard it’ll hit back.

Mort closes the front door and hangs his car keys on a hook, 
old habit. Tosses his jacket over a chair. Alone now, he 
turns and looks into the cabin.
He walks further into the living room, under its cathedral 
ceiling, toward the window-wall facing the lake. He can't see 
anything in the window except himself, the light from the 
lamp makes it a mirror.
He looks at himself for a moment, sees how scared he looks. 
He sees the reflection of the second floor —
— and sees movement up there.
Or was it a bat flying past the window outside?
Mort spins around and locks up to the loft.

Mort, standing in the middle of the living room, licks his 
lips, his mouth gone dry. He's staring up at the loft. 
Because of its shade, the lamp down here throws most of its 
light upwards, the vertical bars in the railing upstairs 
throw exaggerated shadows on the wall and ceiling, they look 
like bars of a jail call.
Mort speaks; it comes out in a soft croak.
MORT
Hello?

Tires spin on gravel as Kalach turns his car around and heads 
down the driveway.
INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Mort is still staring up at the loft.
MORT
Is somebody up there?
No response -- except for a soft SCRATCHING sound from up 
there.
43.
Mort turns quickly, sees Ken’s headlights flash past his 
front windows and disappear up the driveway. Ken's gone. 
Mort's alone.
MORT
(softly)
Shit.
He thinks — am I being ridiculous? Maybe, but why take 
chances? He walks softly over to the fireplace, not sure why 
he's tiptoeing, but moving stealthily. He reaches out and 
gently lifts the ash-shovel from a rack of fireplace tools, 
considers it, then puts it down and takes the poker instead.
He turns toward the upstairs, brandishing the poker, but 
uncomfortable with it. He walks to the stairs.
And begins to climb them. Slowly. Deliberately.
He reaches the second floor landing and pauses, his heart 
pumping in his cheat, trying to breathe silently. The door to 
the guest room is on his left. The door to the bathroom is on 
his right. Both doors are ajar.
Mort stands stock still, poker held aloft, sweat running out 
of his hair and down his cheeks, attempting to work up the 
nerve to open one of those doors, but which one, which one 
has the prize, or does either one, and he's just about to go 
back downstairs --
-- when he hears it again. Louder this time. A definite 
SCRATCHING sound from the upstairs bathroom.
His eyes widen. He turns his head ever so slightly toward it, 
takes about ten seconds to turn six inches.
The SCRATCHING comes again... then silence.
MORT
(suddenly quite loud)
I know you're in there, Fuckhead!
No answer. Mort wipes sweat off the back of his neck with his 
free hand.
He takes a step forward. From his new angle, he can just see 
through the open bathroom door --
-- and he sees Shooter.
44.
Well, he sees a figure. Okay, it's impossible to say whether 
it‘s Shooter or not but there’s a silhouette in there, 
there's somebody in there and who the hell else would it be? 
The figure is in the bathroom, just past the sink, pressed 
into the far earner and he too is holding a weapon aloft, 
something long and hard in his hand, just waiting to clock 
Mort over the head with it.
But Mort has an advantage, shooter apparently hasn't seen 
him.
MORT
You picked the wrong writer to fuck 
with! I've been wanting to kill 
somebody since last March and 
you'll do as well as anybody!
No answer. No movement.
Mort looks to the other door, through which a double bed is 
visible. Clearly a bedroom. He looks again to the bathroom 
door, sees shooter still hiding in there, nearly the same 
position.
Mort thinks. Speaks calmly, but the shake in his voice 
betrays him.
MORT
I know you're in the bedroom!
He takes a step toward the bedroom door, but his ayes are 
darting like crazy to the bathroom.
MORT
I'm counting to five! If you're not 
out of the bedroom by the time I 
get there, I‘m coming in swinging! 
You hear me?
He takes another step toward the bedroom, now presenting his 
back to the bathroom doer and nervous as hall about it. But 
the man has a plan.
MORT
One!
Sweating profusely, he takes another step to the bedroom 
door, now fully in front of it, his back completely exposed 
to the half-open bathroom door.
MORT
Two!
He closes his fingers lightly around the bedroom doorknob.
45.
MORT
Thr--
Ha lets go of the bedroom door and suddenly launches himself 
backwards, SLAMMING into the bathroom door with everything 
he's got.
INT. THE BATHROOM
51
51
the door SLAMS into the wall hard enough to chop through the 
wallpaper and pop the door's lower hinge. Mort plows inside 
fast, straight toward Shooter, poker held aloft, ROARING with 
rage, and Shooter's coming right back at him, also with a 
raised weapon, eyes wide and insane, utterly insane, his 
teeth bared in a killer's grin.
Mort brings the poker down in a whistling overhand blow and 
has just enough time to wince as he realizes that Shooter is 
also swinging a poker, and to realize it isn't Shooter 
swinging at all but it's him.
It's just his reflection.
Too late to stop, he SMASHES the poker into the bathroom 
mirror.
The silver-backed glass sprays every which-way, twinkling in 
the gloom, and the medicine cabinet falls into the sink, its 
bent door swung open like a gaping mouth spilling bottles of 
cough syrup and iodine and Lysterine.
Mort reaches out and flicks on the light, surveys the damage, 
chest heaving. He laughs suddenly.
MORT
I killed a fucking mirror.
He's about to toss the poker aside when he hears that 
SCRATCHING sound again and something moves in the tub behind 
him. He whirls around and slashes sideways with the poker, 
tearing a jagged gash through the corrugated plastic shower 
door and knocking it off its tracks.
He raises the poker over his shoulder, steps forward, and 
peers into the shower.
A fieldmouse scurries frantically in the tub, desperately 
trying to claw its way up the smooth porcelain sides.
Mort looks at the poker in his hand. He's gripped it so hard 
there are traces of blood where his fingernails dug into his 
palm.
46.
He reaches out with hit other hand, pries his own fingers off 
the handle, and tosses the poker aside with a CLANG.
He takes a hand towel from the rack, bends over the tub, and 
in one quick gesture scoops the mouse into it, pinching the 
towel together at the top.
He turns and walks out of the bathroom, past the leaning door 
with its popped hinge, his shoes gritting on broken mirror 
glass.

Showing more purpose than we've seen in a while, Mort comes 
downstairs and heads directly to the little study in the back 
of the house.

Mort BANGS on a light and searches the desk with one hand, 
the other still holding the towel with the SQUEAKING mouse 
inside it.
Mort finds what he was looking for -- the ancient pack of 
L&M's, now down to just two half-flattened cigarette.

Mort scoops up a box of fireplace matches from the hearth and 
heads for the back door.

Mort сomes out the back door of the cabin and stares out at 
the wine-dark lake, glinting under a half moon. He bends down 
and opens the towel, letting the mouse scurry off into the 
safety of the darkness.
Mort stands up, shoves the L&M between his lips, raises a 
match to the scratchy side of the box end gives it a long 
SCRAPE —
— which illuminates John Shooter (really this time), standing 
right beside him.
SHOOTER
Thought you didn’t smoke.
47.
Miraculously, Mort manages to hold the scream of sheer terror 
inside his throat, the only physical evidence of his shook is 
the hesitation in his match hand, which quivers a few inches 
from the end of his unlit cigarette.
Somehow, he manages to resume lighting the butt, shakes out 
the match, and tosses it away. He takes a deep drag. It seems 
to calm him. He speaks levelly, but it's a spitless voice, 
smoke choking his lungs.
MORT
Took it up recently for my health.
SHOOTER
How are you, Mr. Rainey?
Mort exhales a cloud of smoke.
MORT
I'm fine, Mr. Shooter. How about 
you?
Mort's ayes are searching, looking for some kind of weapon, 
anything.
SHOOTER
I’m a country fair. But I don’t 
think you’re really all that well. 
Stealing from another man, that 
don’t seem to have ever bothered 
you none. Being caught up on, 
though... that seems to have given 
you the pure miseries.
MORT
What are you talking about?
SHOOTER
Well, it sounded like you pitched a 
fit or something is there. 
Shouting... whacking on thing... or 
maybe it's just that successful 
writers like you throw tantrums 
when things don't go the way they 
expect. Is that it, maybe?
MORT
The magazine with the story in it 
is at my house in town.
Mort’s ayes dart — a lawn chair, a stack of firewood, a 
shovel stuck in the dirt. A shovel!
SHOOTER
48.
Why didn't you get it? You were 
down there today, weren’t you?
MORT
How do you knew that?
SHOOTER
Why didn't you go inside? ‘Stead of 
just sittin in your car like a damn 
fool?
Shit. He followed me. Shit. Mort tries to keep his voice 
level as he start to walk casually toward the shovel. Shooter 
moves with him, staying just barely in the light.
MORT
When I get the story and show it to 
you, will you leave me alone?
SHOOTER
(lazily amused)
There isn't any magazine with that 
story in it, Mr. Rainey. You and 
me, we know that. Not from 1933, 
there isn't. How could there be, 
when my story wasn't there for you 
to steal until 1995?
MORT
God damn it, I did not steal your 
st-
SHOOTER
No, not all of it, true enough. Not 
the best part.
MORT
What do you want? Tell me! What in 
the hell do you want?
SHOOTER
You want the second reason I came, 
is that it?
MORT
Yes!
Mort reaches the shovel, turns so that he’s in front of it, 
blocking its view from Shooter.
SHOOTER
I want you to fix it.
MORT
49.
What?!
SHOOTER
My ending. The one you wrecked. 
Can’t decide what's worse, stealing 
my story or ruining the ending. 
Most important part of a story, the 
ending. Mine was perfect, it was a 
real ending, not that phony crap 
you shoved in,
(reciting with contempt)
“He looked in her eyes and saw her 
face as he had first known it, as 
if it were ten years ago and none 
of this had ever happened. He fell 
to the ground and into her embrace, 
down in the dirt, down in the piece 
where now things grow." You have 
got to be pardon my language 
fucking kidding ma, Mr, Rainey. Put 
it back the way it ought to be.
MORT
I don’t even remember your ending.
SHOOTER
Oh, I bet yen do. It's hard to 
forget.
(reciting from memory)
"I know I can do it,” Todd Downey 
said, helping himself to another 
ear of corn from the steaming bowl. 
"I'm sure that in time her death 
will be a mystery even to me." 
That's how the story ends, Pilgrim. 
It's the only ending. You're gonna 
write it for me and get it 
published. And it's gonna have my 
name on it. Right has got to be put 
right.
Mort sneaks one hand behind his back, feeling for the shovel 
handle. He speaks, his voice thick with rage.
MORT
The only thing I'll write for you 
is your death-warrant, if you don't 
leave me alone.
Long pause. Shooter eyes hint. Sees where Mort's hand is 
going.
SHOOTER
50.
Saw that wife of yours, comin' out 
of the house.
(exaggerated countryism)
She's purty-
Mort's fingers close around the shovel handle.
MORT
Leave her out of it.
SCOOTER
Would if I could, but I‘m startin' 
to think you ain't going to leave 
me that option.
Mort yanks the shovel from the dirt and swings it around by 
the handle, straight toward Shooter's head.
Shooter stops it with one hand, lays his other on it and 
shoves back. Mort stumbles over the pile of dirt and lends an 
his bask, the wind OOPIHG out of bin. Shooter falls on him, 
holds the shovel with both hands, presses it down on Mort's 
Adam's apple. Mort chokes, Shooter spits words at him.
SCOOTER
Do you want to wake up from one of 
your stupid naps and find Amy 
nailed to your garbage bin? Or turn 
on the radio some morning and hear 
she came off second best in a match 
with the chainsaw you keep out in 
the shed?!
Mort summons his strength, which is considerable, and greater 
than Shooter's, and hurls the man off him. Shooter lands on 
his feat as Mort rolls over to his hands and knees, gagging 
and choking.
SHOOTER
(calmly)
You can't get away with it. Don't 
you realize that yet?
He bends down and picks up his hat, dusts it off and sets it 
back on his head.
SHOOTER
I know what you did, and I ain't 
quitting till right gets put right.
On the ground, coughing up spit and blood, Mort watches as 
Shooter walks away across the yard.

The shattered chunks of mirror are still on the floor of the

twenty-six Mort Raineys coming at us. His hand grows huge as 
ha reaches down and picks up the largest shard.
Mort tucks the shard into a corner of the door of the broken 
medicine cabinet, shoves the whole thing back into its hole 
in the wall.
He leans forward, looking at his reflection in the stand. He 
touches his neck gingerly, runs his fingertips over the

The entire page is blank, it the story he deleted the other 
day. Just a blinking cursor in a big field of white.
Mort, who's sitting at his desk, stares at it ruefully.
MORT
What, you didn’t write anything 
while I was gone? No wonder you're 
not-
He turns and looks at the leather chair Bump always sits in, 
but at course the chair's empty tonight. Forgot for a second.

Amy's house. Nighttime. Mostly dark, but there's a light on 
in one corner of the house, and as we creep closer to that 
light, we see a silhouette moving in the window.
Jerking around, really, and as we get even closer we hear 
CRASHING, breaking sounds. We draw closer and closer still, 
the curtains in the room are parted, we can see between them. 
The room must be Mort's old office, the walls are lined with 
books and bound periodicals, like the lake house, but many, 
many more.
The figure inside is the familiar form of Shooter, capped by 
that creepy hat, which, throws a crazy shadow on the fax 
wall.
He upends the desk, then picks something up off the floor, a 
bottle, looks like champagne, that's funny, and heads for the 
door, stuffing some thing in the neck of the bottle, looks 
like a rag.
He pauses in the doorway, SCRAPES a Zippo and touches the 
rag, which immediately starts on fire. He tosses the bottle 
right at us. It lands on the floor and smashes.
The room EXPLODES into flame, that weren't no champagne in 
the bottle, that was gasoline, end the window we've crept up 
to SHATTERS in our fade.
From the street, we see the ball of fire rise up from the 
corner of the dry old Victorian, taking half the roof with 
it. This baby's gonna burn like cordwood.

Daytime now. The unplugged phone cord lies on the floor in 
Mort's cabin, still a few feet from the phone it should be 
attached to.
On the couch, the pillow is empty, the indentation is still 
there, but no head. Where's Mort?
Moving left, we find Mort sitting on the couch, staring 
straight ahead, still in the clothes he fell asleep in, bed 
hand. No telling how long he's been awake, it looks like he 
swung his legs over the edge of the couch end just stopped in 
that position. He looks awful. That red line is still across 
his throat.
53.
He notices the phone in front of him. Looks to the floor, 
sees the unplugged cord. Mustering all the ambition he has at 
the moment, he bends over and picks up the cord.
He looks at the little clip thing on its end, looks at the 
phone, debating the merits of plugging it in.
Deciding what the hell, he reaches over end jams the cord 
into the back of the phone --
which HINGS immediately. Mort twitches. He’s jumpy anyway, 
but you know, you hate it when that happens.
MORT
Is that you, John Wayne?

Hello.

He's relieved, at least it isn't Shooter.

Mort stands in front of the smoking hulk that was once the

Riverdale. Ha just stares at it, his face slack with shock 
and loss.
The site is cordoned off by police tape, there are three or 
four COPS and two FIRE IBSPECTORS picking carefully through 
the remains. Mort looks at what used to be the house, we peer 
closely at him, then when we see his point of view again —
MORT'S MENTAL IMAGE - AMY'S HOUSE - NEW
-- the house is back the way it used to be, same angle from 
the sidewalk, but the house is freshly painted and clean on a 
summer's day. Amy comes out of the house in a business suit, 
putting shoes on as she hurries to her car, late for a 
meeting.
Mort comes to the door in his boxers and SHOUTS after her.

Hey lady, you only left a hundred

us something.
AMY
It's the best room in the house, at 
least for me. Down here, check it 
out.
She bends down in a corner, shoves some boxes out of the way, 
revealing a window in an odd place, down at floor level. You 
could easily miss it if you didn't look for it.
She slides down the wall next to it, points down.
AMY
See that little patch of dirt? The 
only place you can see it is from 
up here. I went to put a garden 
there.
She pulls her knees up to her chest, stares happily out the 
window.

there's a wistful smile on his face.

He turns, smile still on his lips —
— until he sees Ted striding toward him with Amy, holding her 
hand.
Suddenly, another —

-- and this one isn't nearly so pleasant. It's Mort’s point 
of view of the ugly scene we saw in the opening. He storms 
into the hotel room, Amy and Ted struggle to cover their 
naked bodies, they all scream at each other --

into something hard and hurt by the time they reach him.
MORT
Hi.
Ha hugs her, she hugs him back hard, over her shoulder, he 
makes brief eye contact with Ted, who forces a semi-polite 
grimace.
MORT
(softly, in her ear)
I'm sorry about all of this, Amy. 
All of it. Really sorry.
AMY
So am I.
TED
(alight Southern, accent)
Me too.
MORT
(fuck you, Ted)
Thank you, Ted.
Amy retreats to Ted's side. WICKERSHAM, the fire chief, 
approaches them with a police detective, BRADLEY. Wickersham 
addresses Ted and Amy.
WICKERSHAM
Mr. and Mrs. Rainey?
Three responses, all at once:
AMY

MORT
No.

Uhh...
Wickershan locks back and forth, confused. Any takes a step 
toward Mort's aide.

AMY
We are. Were. The owners.
WICKERSHAM
(now really confused)
Were? You don't own it anymore?
Bradley gives Wickersham a look — figure it out, idiot. Mort 
helps him.
MORT
Were Mr. and Mrs. Rainey. Are the 
owners.
WICKERSHAM
Ah.
BRADLEY
I'm Steven Bradley, I’m a detective 
with the Riverdale P.D., this is 
Fire Chief Wickersham. We won’t 
keep you long, the insurance 
investigator needs to see you in 
the city at three.
WICKERSHAM
You're definitely the victims of 
arson. The fire was started by an 
incendiary device made from a 
bottle of Moet Chandon champagne 
and a couple quarts of plain old 
gasoline.
BRADLEY
So let’s start with enemies. You 
got any?
AMY
No. No one.
TED
Not a soul.
Mort looks at Ted, really irritated.
MORT
Okay with you if I answer these, 
Ted?
Ted holds up his hands, okay, okay. Mort turns to Bradley.
MORT
Yes. I have an enemy.

Amy looks at him. Bradley pulls out his notebook.
CUT TO:
INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY
70
70
Back in the city, back in another office with a great view, 
this time at a conference table. Bradley and FRAN EVANS, an 
insurance investigator in her fifties, are on odd side. Amy, 
Mort, and Ted are on the other. Amy sits between her two men. 
This must be fun.
EVANS
I'm sorry I wasn't there to meet 
you this morning, I spent most of 
last night poking through the site 
with a flashlight and a Polaroid.
(stops herself)
Sorry. Broke one of my own rules. I 
don't like to call it "the site." 
It wasn't a site. It was a house. 
Tour house, and I'm very sorry for 
your loss.
MORT
Thank you...
He glances at her business card, which he’s holding in his 
hand.
MORT
...Mrs. Evans.
EVANS
That still say Mrs.?
(take)
Fran is fine. Look, these meetings 
are difficult. People in your 
situation are already upset, 
understandably so, and quite often 
they take the presence of an 
investigator as an accusation that 
they torched their own property.
AMI
I have to admit, I did feel a 
little on the spot. Thanks for 
bringing it up.
Ted nods, so violently that his head might have been on a 
string. Mort notices, just stares at him. All Ted has to do 
is breathe to irritate Mort.
59.
EVANS
And in this case we certainly seem 
to have a plausible suspect in this 
Mr. Shooter, whom our people will 
investigate aggressively along with 
the police, but in the meantime —
(pulls out a file 
folder})
The hard part.
She puts the file on the table in front of them delicately.
EVANS
It's a list of your claimed 
insurable property. You look it 
over, then sign an affidavit 
swearing that the items listed 
still belong to you, and that they 
ware still in the house when the 
fire occurred. Anything that wasn't 
there, put a check. I’m told there 
was --
(tiny pause)
-- separation of residence 
recently, so that last bit may be 
particularly important.
MORT
We're in a divorce. It isn't final 
yet.
AMY
The settlement agreement is all 
done, everything's ready to go, 
we're really just waiting for it to 
be signed.
(with a quick glance at 
Mort)
By both parties.
Ted looks at Mort too, not such a quick glance. Mort ignores 
them.
MORT
(to Evans)
I moved out six months ago, but I 
hadn’t got around to hauling all my 
stuff out of the house yet.
EVANS
60.
Been down that road. These things 
just have to follow their natural 
course. Things wrap up when 
everybody's ready for that to 
happen,
MORT
(a returned quick glance 
at Amy)
(That's been my feeling.)
EVANS
Do the beat you can with the list.
Amy looks down at it. Mort leans in over her left shoulder.
And Ted leans in over her right shoulder. Amy notices and 
tips the file just a little bit in his direction so they can 
all see it.
Mort is furious, but holds it in. He reaches out and tips the 
file back in his own direction.
AMY
Mort...
MORT
(to Ted, softly livid)
Do you actually intend to 
rubberneck?
The tension in the roam is thick as cake frosting. For a 
moment no one says a word. Detective Bradley's eyes move 
alertly back and forth between the three of them.
TED
(through clenched teeth)
I hardly think-
MORT
I'm not going to freak out about 
this. But this was our stuff, Amy. 
Ours.
TED
It isn’t as if-
AMY
No, he's right, Ted.
EVANS
61.
He is, Mr. Milner. The law says you 
have no right to be looking at the 
listed items at all. We wink at 
something like that if nobody 
minds... but I think Mr. Rainey 
does.
MORT
Yes. Mr. Rainey minds a lot.
Amy switches hea unhappy look of appeal from Mort to Ted. Ted 
stares at Mort evenly --
— and then turns to speak to Amy, ignoring everyone else.
TED
Would it help matters if I took a 
walk around the block?
MORT
Why not make it two?
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
72
72
The meeting over, Mort, Amy, Fran Evans, and Bradley walk 
down the hallway to the elevators. Evans and Bradley are 
talking to one another in the rear, Mort end Amy are in 
front.
Amy puts a hand on Mort’s arm and pulls closer to him.
AMY
I'm lorry about in there, about 
Ted. You have no idea how hard it 
is to be the one in the middle.
Mort sees that she means it and musters up some kindness.
MORT
Shitty situation. So fucking adult, 
huh?
She laughs dryly and node. They reach the elevators.
AMY
Mort, I want to ask you...
(she pots a hand on his 
arm})
I don't want to upset you—
62.
She looks over at Evans end Bradley, who are right behind 
them but Evans catches the look and she and Bradley retreat a 
few steps down the hallway and turn away politely.
Mort looks at Amy, warns to her, is even concerned about her.
MORT
What is it?
Amy turns back to Mort, leans in closer and lowers her voice 
confidentially. He puts his hand on hers.
AMY
Between you and me, okay?
MORT
Absolutely.
AMY
This guy Shooter. His story, I 
mean, Mort, is this situation... is 
it like the other time?
Mort's warmth cools. He withdraws his hand. He's furious.
MORT
Look. That was the only time I ever 
did anything remotely like that, it 
never happened before or since. I 
was just out of grad school, we 
were broke, we thought you were 
pregnant, remember all that?
AMY
Okay, okay...
MORT
It was stupid and desperate and 
I’ve paid for it. I paid the guy 
everything he asked and I've kept 
paying, believe me, every single 
night for about fifteen years. 
You're the only person who knows 
about it besides the lawyers, and 
even though we're not together I 
expect you to keep it that way.
AMY
Fine.
A horrible thought strikes him. He tries to catch her eye.
MORT
You haven't told Ted, have you?
63.
AMY
(unconvincing)
No.
MORT
Have you?
The elevator BINGS, the doors open, and guess who steps off.
TED
Well, do I have timing or what?
MORT
Yeah, I’m sorry you had to miss 
that, Ted. I know how much you like 
my things.
Another awkward silence, which Ted has had just about enough 
of.
TED
(to Mort)
We're going to talk for a minute.
He starts to reach for Mort's arm, thinks better of it, and 
nods sharply over to a corner of the hallway. Mort looks at 
the others.
MORT
Excuse me, I'm in trouble.
IN THE CORNER,
Mort joins Tad, who is pissed off. This is not a side of him 
he shows when he's with Amy.
TED
I've had about enough of your 
bullshit.
MORT
You've had enough?
TED
Marriages and. I'm sorry. I didn't 
end yours, it was over when I got 
there.
MORT
Wow, you must have thought her 
wedding ring was weird, then.
TED
64.
Nevertheless, I apologized to you. 
Months ago. I know yon don't want 
us in your life — guess what, I 
don't want you in mine either. But 
until your divorce is done there's 
not much we can do about it. I just 
want you to know I decided a long 
time ago that I will not let you 
upset Amy any more than you already 
have. I am not prepared to let that 
happen. So let's just wrap this up 
end get out of each other's lives 
permanent.
(a toothy, weird smile)
Okay? Are we gettin’ the message 
I'm sendin' ?
Ted's Southern accent is a bit stronger on that last line. 
Mort looks at him, noticing it.
MORT
Where are you from, Teddy?
TED
Tennessee. Norty.
MORT
Really. I thought maybe 
Mississippi.
TED
No, long way from there. A little 
town called Shooter's Knob, 
Tennessee.
Mort furrows his brow. Did he hear what he thought he heard?
CUT TO:
INT. MORT'S CAR - NIGHT
74
74
Mort drives back to Tashmore Lake with his hands clamped to 
the steering wheel, his spine at straight as a ruler and his 
eyes fixed firmly on the road. He has the radio on, blasting, 
trying to stave off thought.
Doesn't work. He SNAPS the radio off, highly agitated. For 
the first time, we hear his thoughts. (A note about that — 
Mort’s thoughts don't come through clearly, like voice over. 
They swirl and overlap, the way your thoughts do, some just 
whispers, some louder than that, and some fragments spoken 
out loud.)
65.
MORT
(inner voice)
Well that's kind of a
(out loud)
fucking coincidence
(inner voice)
isn’t it?
He rubs his head, thinking, thinking.
MORT
(inner voice)
Maybe he knows him
(out loud)
sending me a message
(inner voice)
gonna fucking figure this out, 
Teddy.
He flicks the radio back on, even louder.
CUT TO:
EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Headlights splash down the driveway of Mort's cabin as a car 
pulls in. The headlights stop, shining right on the cabin 
from about twenty yards away.
INT. MORT’S CAR - NIGHT
76
76
Mort sits in the car, engine idling, looking around the 
property. No sign of another car.
MORT
(inner voice)
Come on, Kelsch...
(aloud)
Five hundred a day and where the 
hell are you when I need you?
He takes one more look around, drops the ear in gear, and 
pulls right up to the front porch, just a few feet from the 
first step. He puts it in park, kills the lights, and gets 
out.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
77

He climbs the steps quickly, keys the frost door, and goes 
inside.

Mort flicks on a light and hangs the keys on the hook by the 
front door, SLAMMIWG and locking the door behind him.
The phone RINGS.
MORT
Gee, I bet it's good news.
He reaches for it.
INT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT
78
78
Ken Kelsch is sprawled out an the bright orange bedspread in 
small town motel, a couple mini-bar bottles are open on the 
bedside table next to him, he’s drinking bourbon and water 
out of a plastic bathroom cup. The Chestos look good too.
KELSCH
(into the phone)
Where the hell you been all day?
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
78A
78A
Mort's standing in the living room, phone in hand.
MORT
I might ask you the sane question.
KELSCH (O.S.)
Relax, you're fine, I checked your 
cabin an hour ago.
MORT
He shoved up right after you left 
last night.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
79
79
Kelsch sits up.
KELSCH
Really? Then he had a busy night. 
My office called me about your 
Riverdale house. I'm sorry.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
79A
79A
MORT
67.
The worst part is I hadn't got the 
magazine from my study yet. The one 
with the story he says I stole. Now 
it went up in the fire.
KELSCH (O.S.)
You still want to go through with 
it? Meeting him, showing him the 
magazine?
MORT
Hell yes. I've spent the last half 
year walking through a shitstorm, 
Ken, having things happen to me. 
This is something I want to handle 
myself. He can go to jail or go 
away or go to hall, it's all the 
same to me. As long as he's gone.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
80
80
Kelsch turns, swings his legs off the bed.
KELSCH
Good. Because I called your agent 
when I heard about the house, I 
figured he'd have a copy of the 
magazine. He sent an original by 
overnight today, you can pick it up 
at your post office tomorrow after 
three.
MORT (O.S.)
I knew there was a reason I hired 
you.
KELSCH
There's something else. I caught up 
with your Tom Greenleaf today. The 
guy that drove past you and Shooter 
on the Lake Road.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
81
81
MORT
Yeah?
KELSCH (O.S.)
You're not gonna like this.
MORT
He didn't see anything?
68.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
81A
81A
Kelsch consults his notepad.
KELSCH
Worse. First he says he did go down 
Lake Drive on Tuesday and he saw 
you like you said, but then he gets 
weird, says no no no, come to think 
of it I didn't. Didn't see anybody. 
Wasn't even on Lake Drive on 
Tuesday.
MORT (O.S)
Well, Tom's seventy-five if he's a 
day. Might've slipped his mind.
KELSCH
Bullshit. He was way up on a 
scaffold when I saw him, painting 
your Parish Hall. Looked strong as 
an ok to me.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
82
82
MORT
Doesn't mean his memory's good.
KELSCH (O.S.)
Don't be naive. The guy was scared 
shitless. Somebody got to him.
MORT
Come on, why would Shooter possibly 
care if Tom Greenleaf knows he's 
here?
KELSCH (O.S.)
That depends.
MORT
On what?
KELSCH (O.S.)
On what he plans to do to you. I‘m 
revising my opinion, Mort. I don’t 
think Shooter's just some nut, 
intimidation of witnesses speaks to 
a thought-out plan.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
83
83
69.
Kelsch speaks carefully. Doesn't want to be too alarming — 
which of course he is.
KELSCH
We need to consider the possibility 
that he was hired to do this. 
Somebody with a grudge against you, 
hires a tough guy to rattle you, 
scare you to death. But he hires 
the wrong guy. Things get out of 
control. They go further than 
they're supposed to... dead doge, 
burned-down houses. Now he can't 
call him off.
INT. CABIN - NIGHT
84
84
Mort nags to the coffee table. He speaks quietly.
MORT
Ted.
KELSCH (O.S.)
Who?
MORT
He's trying to gaslight me.
KELSCH (O.S.)
Who's Ted?
MORT
Amy's... the guy Amy left me for. 
Maybe that's why the guy calls 
himself Shooter, Ted wants me to 
know it's him. Trying to intimidate 
me, send me a message.
KELSCH (O.S.)
Why? What does he want?
MORT
I don't knew.
KELSCH
Did you piss him off? Give him a 
reason to hate you?
Mort thinks about that, closes his eyes. A flash of something 
crosses the screen, very fast, it could have been the motel 
room from the opening, probably was, it's hard to tell. Mort 
snaps his eyes open.
70.
MORT
Might have.
KELSCH
Okay, here's what we do. What other 
proof do you have that Shooter was 
hero? Other than the manuscript, 
Physical evidence, I'm talking 
about.
Mort strains to think, a hand to the side of his head, 
remembering the episode ode with Shooter by the lake. Images 
from their encounter flash past;
EXT. PATH BY THE LAKE - DAY
84A
84A
-- Shooter gats in Mort's face, GROWLS at him;
SHOOTER
You lie.
-- Shooter's hands grab Mort by the biceps and shove him back 
against the car, hard.
— Shooter‘s hands, holding Mort’s arms, hard. His fingers and 
thumbs pressing in so hard they're turning white.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
86
86
MORT
Hold the phone a sec.
He drops the receiver and shoves his sleeves up as far as 
they'll go. He holds out his arms. At first he sees nothing, 
than he rotates them outward as far as they'll go and there 
they are, two yellowing bruises on the inside of each arm, 
just above the elbow — marks made by Shooter’s thumbs.
SACK OH THE COUCH,
Mort picks up the phone again.
MORF
Bruises. On my arms, where he 
grabbed me.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
86A
86A
KELSCH
71.
Not very concrete, but it's 
emotional, it might get to him. You 
and me are gonna go see Greenleaf 
together. Bring the manuscript, 
bring your bruises. I‘m gonna push 
the guy hard, make it impossible 
for him to lie. If he’ll tell the 
police he was threatened too, then 
we've got something, it certainly 
ties him to the fire.
MORT (O.S.)
I’ll meet you at Bowie's for 
breakfast.
KELSCH
9 a.m, sharp.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
87
87
MORT
See you there.
KELSCH (O.S.)
And bring your six gun, Pilgrim.
Mort, who was about to hang up, freezes at that last word.
KELSCH (O.S.)
I’m kidding.
(no response)
You still there?
MORT
Yeah. I’ll see you at nine.
He hangs up quickly. Sits there staring at the phone for a 
long moment, hunched over it.
CUT TO:
INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT
88

Mort‘s in bed. Wide awake. He looks up at the ceiling. Flips 
over. Flops the other way. He bolts out of bed, dragging the 
blankets with him and heads —
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
88A
88A
72.
- into the darkened living room, straight for the couch, 
Except this time we don’t even see Mort, we are Mort, 
drifting toward the couch, sucked in by it, down into its 
pillow, between its cushions, into its inky recesses.
We roll over, face up at the ceiling. The entire roam recedes 
from us, as if we're falling into a deep deep hole, but we 
don't mind that much, at least it's quiet, and we know we'll 
see nothing in that hole that frightens us because at its 
bottom there is only
BLACK.
INT. CABIN - DAY
88B
88B
Just as we went into the hole, we rise slowly out of it, out 
of the black toward a pinprick of light in the distance. 
We're pulled toward the light the way we were sucked into the 
black, but this hurts more, it's that bright.
We come up out of the couch into the living room, wicked 
bright with morning sunlight.
Mort winces from it, his head still deep in the pillow.
He sits up, swings his legs off the couch —
— and GROANS in pain, a groan so loud it's almost a muted 
scream. His hands dart up, he tries to hold his back, his 
knees, and his right arm all at the same time.
MORT
Oh my God...
He rubs his right shoulder, tries to message some life into 
it.
MORT
(inner voice)
that door
(aloud)
how hard did
(inner voice)
bathroom door
(aloud)
hard did I hit it?
He squints across the room, to a clock on the far wall.
It's a quarter after ten.
MORT
Oh shit.
73.
He gets to his feet, painfully, and whips on a tee shirt. 
He's still wearing his pants.
Feet step into shoes and he heads for the door. He reaches up 
to snatch his car keys from the hook --
— but they're not there. He looks. That’s weird. Thought he 
left then there last night.
He pats his pockets. Hope. Turns and looks around the room. 
Huh uh.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
90
90
Mort’s car keys are sitting on the counter in the kitchen. He 
comes through the swinging door, looks around the room, spots 
them.
He comes over and picks them up, bounces them thoughtfully on 
the palm of his hand.
MORT
(inner voice)
Don’t like that.
(out loud)
Don’t like that at all.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
90A
90A
Mort crosses the living room, throws open the front door —
EXT. FROM PORCH - DAY
91
91
— and stops in his tracks.
Shooter's hat is lying on the porch in front of the door.
The distinctive black hat with the round crown. Mort stands 
there looking at it, his heart beating in his ears (and 
ours).
Mort steps down off the porch, cutting a wide semi-circle 
around the hat, and stands where his car ought to be, right 
in front of the porch, where he left it last night. He looks 
around, sees it parked over next to the garage, a hundred 
feet away.
He looks down at the keys in his hand, turns and looks back 
at the hat on the porch.
74.
INT. BUICK - DAY
91A
91A
Mort rips open the door of the car and slides behind the 
wheel. His eye is caught by the ashtray, which is hanging 
open, four cigarette butts in it.
He reaches down and pulls one out, pinching it between his 
fingernails. He holds it up to look at it. Unfiltered Pall 
Mall.
Mort chucks it back into the ashtray as if it were 
radioactive.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY
92
92
Mort picks up Shooter's bat with the same distaste he showed 
the cigarette butt. He flips it over, peers into it. Nothing 
out of the ordinary, just a very old sweat-stained inner 
band.
The band is dark and slick. Mort catches a whiff of it and 
furrows his brow. Recognizes that smell but can't place it.
EXT. BUICK - DAY
93
93
The hat sails into the trunk of the Buick and the lid SLAMS 
shut ever it.
The car sprays gravel out of the driveway.

GERDA
Mort Rainey!
The door to Bowie's Store BANGS shut behind Mort, who winces 
at the noise as half a dozen heads turn from the counter 
where GERDA BOWIE, tall and busty and loud, is serving 
breakfast to a bunch of LOCALS. The store part of Bowie's is 
in the back, the front is a coffee shop.
GERDA
Haven't seen you in a coon's age! 
Writing any good books lately?
MORT
Trying. Falling.
75.
He looks around the place for Kelsch, who isn't there. Damn 
it, missed him. Mort takes a seat at the far end of the 
counter, a few stools away from everybody else.
As Gerda finishes serving the others, Mort calls out to her.
MORT
Gerda, you wouldn't make me one of 
your bacon and cheese and whatevar-
the-hell-else-you-got omelettes, 
would you?
GERDA
Shit no!
She laughs to show she's only joking. The other man at the 
counter, Public Works guys in green coveralls, laugh along 
with her.
GERDA
Gimme a minute.
Mort nods as the PW guys steal glances at him. They find him 
odd, always have, and they're not too shy to stare. Mort's 
uncomfortable, he looks away.
To his left, a BUSBOY is stocking the cigarette rack next to 
the cash register. He has a carton of Pall Malls and is 
taking the packs out one at a time, loading them into the 
rack. Mort stares at the brand. The Busboy notices and looks 
back at him.
BUSBOY
Would you like a pack?
He holds one of the red packs out to Mort enticingly.
MORT
I don't smoke.
GERDA
Good for you, honey.
She flips Mort's coffee cup right side up and pours him some.
GERDA
(lowers her voice)
Heard about your divorce, Mort. I'm 
sorry.
MORT
Thanks, Gerda.
GERDA
76.
Are you taking care of yourself?
MORT
Workin' on it.
GERDA
Because you look a little peaky.
He looks up at her, tries to hide his annoyance.
MORT
It's hard work getting to sleep 
some nights. I guess I'm not used 
to the quiet yet.
GERDA
Bullshit. It's sleeping alone, 
you're not used to yet. But a man 
doesn't have to sleep alone 
forever, Mort, just because some 
fool woman-
MORT
(Getting her off})
Did a guy come in here this morning 
looking for me? Around nine 
o'clock?
OSRDA
No.
MORT
Big guy, very New York cop?
GERDA
No. No, doesn't ring a bell.
MORT
Nine o'clock? I was supposed to 
meet him but I overslept.
GERDA
Maybe he did too, 'cause he sure as 
hell wasn't in here.

Mort pulls up in front of the Parish Sail, one side of which 
is covered in scaffolding. An old Ford Bronco is parked in 
front with a camper on the back and a sign reading SONNY 
TROTTS PAINTING - CARETAKING - CARPENTRY on each of the 
doors.
Mort gets out of his Buick and walks over to the base of the 
scaffolding. He calls up to BONNY TROTTS, fortyish, slapping 
paint onto the aiding three stories up.
MORT
Sonny! Hey, Sonny!
Sonny goes on painting, can't hear Mort over the Roger 
Whittaker song playing on his boom box.
MORT
SONNY!
Sonny jerks. White paint flies from the end of his brush and 
for a moment it looks like be might fall, but he grabs onto 
one of the ropes and steadies himself. He looks down.
SONNY
Why, Mr. Rainey! You gave me a 
helluva turn!
MORT
I'm sorry. I thought you were going 
to fall off.
SONNY
Not me. Tom might fall off, maybe, 
but not me.
MORT
Yon seen him today? Tom?
SONNY
Never showed up. ’Course that ain't 
unusual for Tom, if his sciatica's 
at it.
MORT
Anybody come around looking for 
him?
SONNY
Well...
(thinks)
You.

Mort drives out of town on the main road, headed back to his 
house. As he passes a gas station he does a double take, 
catching sight of a car parked at the pumps.
It's a purple BMW.
A guy is standing near the rear of the car, at the gas tank, 
facing the road. He locks awfully familiar. He should. It’s 
Ted.
A horn BLARES, Mort snaps his head back toward the road to 
avoid hitting the oncoming truck, then he stomps on the 
brakes.
Amazement is replaced by anger. He SLAMS the car into reverse 
and backs up —
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
98
98
hauling it into the gas station parking lot right up beside 
Ted's car. Mort gets out of the car coolly and saunters over 
to Ted, who's screwing the gas cap back on.
MORT
(ice)
What are you doing here?
TED
As a matter of fact, I was just on 
my way over to your place.
MORT
(glancing around)
Where's your buddy?
TED
I came alone.
MORT
Sure you did.
(looks him in the eye)
I know what you're up to.
TED
Fair enough.
Ted stares at Mort. His tone is vague and threatening, he's 
choosing his words very carefully.
TED
Look, I admit...

He swallows, and we detect something else in him. Ted is 
nervous. Or is he scared? Ha's hard to read.
TED
Mort, a lot of what's going on 
right now is my fault. Most of it, 
in fact.
MORT
So you're admitting it?
TED
I sort of got this ball rolling, 
and the truth is now I'm afraid I 
won't be able to stop it.
Mort stares him down. A quiet rage is brewing inside him.
MORT
What do you want?
TED
I want you to end things. Once and 
for all.
Ted pulls something from his shoulder bag, a thick sheat of 
legal-looking papers.
TED
You need to sign your papers, Mort.
Mort just stares at him, aghast.
TED
Amy and I can't go on until your 
story is put to rest.
MORT
What the fuck is... my divorce 
papers?! Tell her to send ’em to my 
lawyer.
TED
She did. He said you-
MORT
That's what this has all been 
about? Getting me to sign the God 
dawn settlement?
TED
Just cool down a minute...
MORT
80.
(putting it all together)
My God, it's because of the book 
deal, isn't it? Because my deal's 
up in a few months, and you two 
want me to sign now so I'm locked 
into higher alimony for the next 
tea years. That's what this is, 
it's money, Jesus Christ, this is 
all about money! And you two think 
you’re gonna muscle me for it?!
TED
I'd hate to see where things could 
end up if we let this go on. I 
think you know what I mean.
MORT
Well Teddy, I think I do, but 
here's the problem. I don't respond 
well to intimidation. I never have. 
Brings out my inner asshole.
Ha gives Tad a hard shove is the shoulder, halfway between a 
punch and a push.
MORT
See what I mean?
He gives me another hard shove, in the other shoulder. Harder 
than the last.
MORT
Just gets you all riled up, doesn’t 
it? So whatever else you think you 
got for me, bring it on. You 
started this? You're gonna finish 
it? Fuck you, it's out of your 
control and you know it. I‘m going 
to finish this. Do me a favor and 
tell —
(a hard finger in Tad's 
cheat)
-- that to your little friend.
Suddenly enraged, Ted lashes out, unleashing a hard right 
cross that's headed straight at Mort's jaw. Mort bobs to the 
right, fast reflexes, just missing the punch, which lands --
-- on the driver's window of Ted's car. There's a sharp 
CRACK, but the glass is intact, so it wasn't the window. It 
was two bones in Ted's hand.
Ted CRIES OUT in pain and crumples to his knees. Mort looks 
down at him.

MORT
Got yourself a temper, huh? So do 
I.

Back home. Mort sits on the couch in his living room, arms 
folded across his chest, staring at something on the coffee 
table.
Shooter's hat. Dead center on the tabletop.
Mort sits forward, inspects it more closely. He's just 
reaching out to pick it up when —
— the phone RINGS at about four thousand decibels. Mort jumps 
a foot, as if suddenly awakened.
MORT
About time, Ken.
(answers it)
Hello?
SHOOTER (O.S.)
Go to where we met the other day.
Mort freezes, recognizing Shooter’s voice.
SHOOTER (O.S.)
Walk down the path a little way.
MORT
Why!
SHOOTER (O.S.)
You impress me as a man who thinks 
the way old folks chew their food, 
Mr. Rainey, but I'm willing to give 
you all the time you need. I'll 
catch up with you this afternoon. 
Anybody you call between now and 
than is your responsibility.
MORT
What did you do?
But there's only a dead line.
MORT
(a whisper)
What in God's name did you do?
82.
CUT TO:
EXT. PATH BY THE LAKE - DAY
102
102
Mort scrambles up the hillside on the path by the lake, 
through the beaten-down bushes on either side. He's breathing 
hard, sweating, stumbling, he must have run all the way from 
his house.
He reaches the top of the hill, comes out into the clearing 
at the edge of Lake Drive, and sees it.
Tom Greenleaf’s Scout, the same car that drove past the other 
day when Greenleaf saw Mort and Shooter talking by the side 
of the road.
Two men are inside the car, one in the driver's seat, the 
other in back. Neither one is moving.
Mort edges closer, starting to hyperventilate.
Tom Greenleaf is behind the wheel with his head thrown back
— and a screwdriver buried to the hilt in his forehead, above 
his right eye.
MORT
Oh God... oh my God... oh Jesus...
Mort's eyes lock onto the screwdriver handle. It's 
distinctive, a badly chipped red plastic handle, the same 
screwdriver Mort pulled out of Bump.
It's Mort‘s.
Mort's head snaps to get the bad news from the back seat, Ken 
Kelsch is back there, a hatchet planted in the top of his 
head.
His eyes are open. Brains have trickled down around his ears 
and dried.
Written along the hatchet's handle in faded but still legible 
red letters is one word — RAINEY.
Mort stands completely still, not even breathing. The world 
swims around him, it slows to a near stop, most sound drains 
away, and the sounds that don't become unnaturally loud.
A CHICKADEE calls.
A WOODPECKER taps on a tree.
83.
A freshening breeze raises whitecaps on the lake.
There is a rustling sound behind Mort. He wheels around so 
fast he almost falls -- would have fallen, if he hadn't had 
the Scout to lean against.
It‘s a squirrel. It looks down at Mort with bright hate from 
where it's frozen halfway up the trunk of a maple tree, 
blazing with red fall flare.
Mort stares at the squirrel for a long moment. The squirrel 
stares back. Sweat runs down Mort's cheek. He's still not 
breathing. He tries to GASP, nothing comes in, his lungs are 
clenched and empty.
FROM MORT'S POINT OF VIEW
the world divides into dozens of neat rectangular bores, 
dozens of identical images of the squirrel on the tree, then 
the images start to move, to tilt up, it's sky, than it’s the 
scout, then it's the ground, we realize Mort is falling --
BACK BY THE PATH
— and his face SMACKS into the dirt as he loses 
consciousness.

Mort opens his eyes. He's still lying next to the Scout, but 
the sun has shifted quite a bit. He sits up groggily and 
turns his wrist to look at his watch. His ayes are too blurry 
from sleep, he squints and pulls the watch closer.
SHOOTER (O.S.)
A quarter past two.
Mort looks up. Shooter is standing over him, silhouetted by 
the sun, which is directly behind his head.
SHOOTER
You been out about three hour. 
Thought you had a heat stroke, only 
it isn't summer.
Mort tries to get up, but his right leg is dead weight under 
him, it buckles and he collapses again.
SHOOTER
84.
You laid on the damn thing. Woulda 
moved you, but I didn't want to 
wake you.
Mort drags himself back against the Scout, lifts his right 
leg over his left, and starts pounding on it with his fists, 
trying to get some blood back into it.
SHOOTER
Got tired of waitin' and almost 
pinned a note on you. Decided not 
too. You scare too easy.
MORT
(still pounding his leg)
I know what‘s going on! I know Ted 
hired you!
SHOOTER
Hired me? Somebody hired me? I 
ain't never worked a day for 
another man in my life. No sir, 
like I said right off, this is 
between you and me.
Mort is frantically hammering on his leg, trying to get it to 
function again.
SHOOTER
Keep bastin' on it like that and 
you'll never walk.
Mort starts dragging himself away from Shooter, across the 
dirt and to the head of the path. Shooter follows lazily.
SHOOTER
Wouldn't crawl too far if I were 
you. You got yourself some work to 
do here. I hooked you to those two 
men in more ways than you know. If 
you leave 'em here and I disappear, 
Mr. Rainey, you are going to find 
yourself standing with your head in 
a noose and your feet in Crisco.
MORT
You don't scare me.
SHOOTER
Yeah, I do. The only thing is, 
you're startin' to scare me a 
little, too. I can't quite figure 
you out.
85.
Mort stops dragging himself, realizing its pointlessness. He 
turns, looks up at his tormentor, at the end of his rope.
MORT
What do you want from me?
Shooter squats in front of Mort.
SHOOTER
(almost kindly)
Why, I told you that already, Mr. 
Rainey. I want you to fix my story. 
The one you stole. Or ain't you 
ready to admit it yet?
MORT
(for the thousandth time)
I did not... steal... your story.
SHOOTER
(sighs)
No, I expect you'll let yourself go 
to Greenhaven for murder before 
you'll admit it.
MORT
I didn't! I didn't! You're crazy, 
and I can prove it! I have the 
magazine, yon lunatic! Do you hear 
me? I have the goddam' magazine!
The response to this is no response.
MORT
Did you hear what I said?!
SHOOTER
(softly)
You have it? You have this so-
called magazine? Right now?
MORT
No.
SHOOTER
Well, there...
MORT
It’s coming Federal Express. I'll 
have it at three, I can pick it up 
in town at three o'clock.
SHOOTER
86.
Pick what up? Some fuzzy old thing 
that's supposed to be a copy?
MORT
No. The magazine. The actual 
magazine, dated 1993, two full 
years before you wrote your story.
SHOOTER
There can't be any magazine. Not 
with that story in it. That story 
is mine!
For the first time, there was - something like real anguish 
in Shooter's voice.
MORT
Three o'clock. I'll meet you at 
four. Someplace public.
SHOOTER
No. Your house.
MORT
You’ll kill me.
SHOOTER
You? No, sir! These others here 
were going to get in the way of our 
business. I couldn’t have that... 
and I figured I could use them to 
make you face up to your 
responsibility. That's all.
(checks his watch)
Your house in two hours.
(jerks a thumb at the 
Scout)
You got some heavy lifting here 
first. I'd get to it if I were you.
Ha stands up to go.
SHOOTER
By the way.... if you talk to that 
Sheriff of yours again, or if you 
don’t show up at four o’clock... I 
will burn your life and every 
person in it like a canefield in a 
high wind. You’ll go to jail for 
killing those two men; but that'll 
be the least of your sorrows. 
Understand?
MORT
87.
And suppose, just suppose, I show 
you the magazine, and it has my 
name on the contents page and my 
story inside. What then?
SHOOTER
(thinks)
Then I turn myself in. But I'll 
take care of myself before a trial, 
Mr. Rainey. Because if things turn 
out that way, than I suppose I am 
crazy. And that kind of crazy 
man... that kind of crazy man has 
no excuse or reason to live.
He starts to walk away, than turns back with one last 
thought.
SHOOTER
Listen, you got my hat. I'll want 
it, one way or the other.
And he disappears down the lake path.
Mort turns, shaking, and looks at the Scout and the dead sea 
in it. From down the road, he hears the HUM of a car engine, 
sees sunlight glinting off the windshield of an approaching 
car.
He slithers back onto the incline, out of sight except for 
his eyes.
The car ZIPS past, takes no notice of the scout and its 
lifeless occupants. Mort takes a deep breath.
A MOMENT LATER - PATH BY THE LAKE
106
106
We‘re looking at the door handle of the Scout. Mort's 
trembling hand, wrapped in his shirt tail, reaches out and 
opens it slowly, revealing Tom Greenleaf's corpse in the 
front seat.
Mort stands there, breathing hard. First things first, that 
screwdriver's gotta come out of his head.
Mort tries to get himself between Tom and the steering wheel, 
but there isn’t room. He reaches down, to the electric seat 
adjustor, and pushes it toward the back.
The seat HUMS back, sliding Tom along with it.
In back, Ken Kelsch shifts, turning toward Mort abruptly.
88.
Mort SHOUTS and jumps bask, he’s still alive!
But Kelsch stops, and Mort takes another look. No way he's 
alive with a hatchet in his head. Mort pushes the seat lever 
back again and Kelsch shifts again -- the driver's seat is 
pushing up against his dead legs.
How there's room for Mort to get between Greenleaf and the 
steering wheel. He wedges himself in, lays a forearm against 
Greenleaf's cheat, closes his free hand around the 
screwdriver —
MORT
I'm sorry, Tom.
— and gives it an almighty yank. Just as the screwdriver 
starts to slide out with a WET CRUNCH —
CUT TO:
EXT. QUARRY - DAY

107
The bloody screwdriver and the axe, both with dried human 
matter dulling their blades, lie on the ground, removed from 
their victims.
Mort stands beside the Scout now, its driver's door closed.
We're in a different location, also abandoned. The Scout is 
running and Mort is reaching through the driver's window, 
putting his hands on the wheel.
Straining, he reaches over and puts the thing in drive. The 
car's parked on a slight hillside and it starts to roll. Mort 
walks alongside, keeping up with it, steering it straight 
ahead.
It picks up speed and Mort has to jog --
-- toward the edge of a sheer rock face. The sparkling waters 
of an abandoned quarry are visible far below.
The Scout moves faster still, it'll make it over the edge on 
its own and Mort is just about to pull himself out when the 
car goes over a bump and Tea Greenleaf's body pitches forward 
over the wheel. Tom's a heavy guy, and his weight and awkward 
posture pin Mort's arms where they are.
The HORN begins to blare.
89.
The Scout moves faster now, Mort is running to keep up with 
the rolling, bumping, HOMKING thing. Mort yanks his arms as 
hard as he can and manages to shove Greenleaf’s body back off 
him, but the open part of the cuff of Mort's overshirt slips 
over the gear shift lever.
Mort is running as fast as he can, struggling like hell to 
free his arm, now stuck by his shirt to the gear shift. The 
car's bouncing along fast, Mort's feet lift off the ground, 
he's running out of real estate fast, he's going over with 
the God damn thing.
He gives his arm one vicious pull, half the threads in the 
button at the end of his sleeve RIP out, the other half stay 
put, the Scout's front tires are just a few feat away from 
the edge of the rock face —
— Mort HAULS his am back as hard as he can —
— the final threads RIP free, the button pops off -
— but so does Mort's wristwatch, which falls to the floor of 
the Scout, the engraved words "I LOVE YOU, AMY" glittering in 
sun --
-- and Mort stops abruptly, windmilling his arms at the very 
edge of the earth as the Scout tips over the edge and 
plummets two hundred feet, SPLASHING into the water.
Mort watches as the Scout bubbles and bobs and disappears 
into the deep-bottomed black quarry waters below.

The clock on the wall in Mort's cabin -- it's ten to three.
On the coffee table, the phone RINGS. It's in the foreground, 
big. After three rings, Mort bursts through the door in the 
background, dumps his shirt, grabs his wallet, his car keys 
from the hook (they're there this time) and heads beck for 
the door.
But through it all, the phone keeps RINGING. In the doorway 
in the background, Mort stops, thinks,
RING. RING. RING. Somebody sure is insistent.
Mort turns, is it biff?
He CURSES and edges over to the phone.

Amy is sitting on the edge of a bed in a man's bedroom, a 
room we haven't seen before. She's bean crying, still is. She 
speaks softly, casts the occasional look to the bedroom door, 
which is closed.
AMY
Mort, I... I've been so worried 
about you.
Mort rolls his eyes, locks over at the clock on the wall.
MORT
I'm okay, Amy.
AMY
Are you sure? When I saw you 
yesterday, I thought you looked... 
strained. I mean, I know you are 
strained, but...
(a new thought)
Do you... Mort, do you...
MORT
What?
AMY
Do you think things would have been 
dlfferent if we'd had children?
MORT
Jesus, I don't know, Amy. Look, can 
I call you later? I gotta be 
someplace.
He glances at his wrist to check the time, but his watch is 
gone. He's puzzled, but doesn't have time to think about it, 
as Amy starts to cry. Mort sighs and sits on the edge of the 
coffee table. Please God, let me out of this conversation.
91.
MORT
What is it?
More crying.
MORT
Take a breath.
Sniffling.
MORT
Are yon at Ted's?
AMT
Yes.
KORT
(knows he shouldn't, 
can't help it)
How do you feel about him, these 
days?
AMY
I love him.
MORT
Right.
AMY
I didn't go with other men. I've 
always wanted to tell you that. I 
didn't go with other man. Only Ted. 
And only the last few months, when 
you and me were... when it was over 
already.
MORT
It we were "over" when we were 
still together, you might have, 
mentioned it. Because it was fuckin 
news to me.
AMY
That's because you weren't there 
anymore. You were gone so much.
MORT
What are you talking about? I 
worked at home, for Christ's sake.
AMY
92.
That's not what I mean. Even when 
you were with me, you wore gone. Up 
in your head. You used to joke 
about it, you'd tap the side of 
your head, "Going up to the attic, 
honey, see you in a few days." That 
was no joke. I don't think I looked 
into your eyes and saw you looking 
back at me, really with me, for the 
last two years.
MORT
Yeah, it's all my fault.
AMY
No, I was a coward. Ted wanted us 
to go and tell you together. He 
kept asking, and I kept putting him 
off. I’ll never forget the look on 
your face when you opened the door 
of that motel room. I'll carry that 
to my grave.
Mort closes his eyes to try to hold off the memory, but good 
luck with that —-

twisted and pained and angry, really angry, but it's just a 
flash and then we're —

AMY
Can't we-
MORT
No, I really gotta go.
AMY
Will you call if you need ma?
93.
MORT
I doubt it.
AMY
Can I come up there?
MORT
Why on earth would you do that?
AMY
(pause, than blurts it 
out)
You still haven't signed the 
papers, Mort. I know you don't want 
to deal with it, I didn't want to 
either, but come on. Everything's 
been negotiated, we don't disagree 
about a thing, I don't understand 
why you're refusing to sign. Don't 
you want it over with?
Mort shakes his head -- so that's why the phone call.
MORT
You're "worried about me." And I 
believe you. What an idiot.
AMY
I am worried. You sound that way, 
Mort, you sound like you did six 
months ago and it’s my fault, I 
think it's my fault and I wish I 
could take it back but­ --

I guess you shouldn't have fucked

You threw a punch at him, Ted. You 
went up to get a simple signature 
and came back with a broken hand. 
If you walk through the door with 
me, just the sight of you is gonna

Ted can see the truth in that. She puts a hand on his cheek.
AMY
I was married to the guy for ten

just want to get this over with. 
That’s all he wants. Bring things

A Federal Express truck ROARS past, revealing Mort’s car, 
parked outside the post office. Mort is inside it, staring at 
the departing truck.
He looks at the post office. Doesn't want to go in. Is 
desperate to go in.
ON THE STREET
Mort's car door slams. As he starts across the street toward 
the building, a VOICE calls to him.
He turns. Down the block, he sees Dave Newsome, the Sheriff 
he spoke to earlier, gesturing to him.
Mort looks around, not now, Dave. Is Shooter watching him?
He waves back to Newsome and keeps walking, pretending he 
doesn't hear the Sheriff's "hold up a sec."
He hurries up the steps of the building.

The post office is nearly empty, but an innocuous government 
building never seemed so menacing. At the far end, there's a 
single clerk behind the counter, JOLIET STOKER, mid-thirties, 
born, bred and will die in Tashmore Lake.
She looks right at us, smiles as we float up to her counter. 
She says something to us, but we don't hear it, just see her 
lips move. She furrows her brow, worried about us. She speaks 
again, this time we hear her:
JULIET
Mr. Rainey? Are you all right?
Mort clears his throat, collects himself.
MORT
Sorry, Juliet. My throat kind of 
double-clutched on me for a second.
JULIET
You're very pale.
She frowns, not sure what to do with him, as if he’s a 
slightly irritating child prodigy who needs special care and 
feeding.
Mort steadies himself, gripping the counter.
96.
MORT
Something I ate last night, I 
guess. Did Federal Express leave 
anything for me?
JULIET
No, not a thing.
Mort’s finger's squeeze the counter ferociously, turning 
white.
MORT
Pardon me?
JULIET
(already tuning away)
Just the one thing, I said.
She pulls a package off the hack rack and slides it across 
the counter to him, its bright red and blue Fed Ex lettering 
like a lighthouse in a storm.
MORT
(sighs in relief)
Thank you.
JULIET
Welcome. You know, the post office 
would have a cow if they knew we 
handle that Federal Express man's 
mail.
MORT
Well, I certainly appreciate it.
He picks up the package and resists the urge to tear it open 
on the spot.
JULIET
You won't tell them, will you?
Mort forces a smile and a grisly wink.
MORT
No way.
JULIET
Good.
Mort turns and heads for the door.
JULIET
Because I saw what you did.
97.
MORT
(STOPS)
Pardon me?
JULIET
I said they'd shoot me if you did. 
You ought to go home and lie down,

Mort comes out of the post office and stops. He flips the

down, looking through the passenger window.
DAVE NEWSOME
Hiya! Got a minute?
Mort tosses the still-unopened Fed Ex package on the

Finally, a moment of peace. Mort picks up the Fed Ex package 
and holds it in his hands, determined to open it this time.
But as he starts to turn it over, a soft grayness comes over 
his vision. Things dull, bend, darken. He tries to blink it 
away, his lids close for just a second --
— and then it’s gone. Whole thing only took three or four 
seconds. That's odd.
Okay, no more bullshit. Mort flips the Fed Ex envelope over 
in his hands, reaches for the tear strip —
— and finds it half pulled off.
The package has already been opened.
MORT
... the fuck... ?
He rips the tear strip the rest of the way off. He turns the 
envelope upside down and a magazine drops into his lap. 
Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, the logo says in bright red 
letters. Beneath that, in much smaller type, June, 1993.
MORT
1993.
Allowing himself a grin smile, he flips it open, looking for 
the contents page.
MORT
Contents...
99.
He flips back and forth, can't find it. He goes back to the 
beginning, where the page ought to be, and finds a thin strip 
of paper in the magazine's gutter. He thinks he knows what 
that means. With growing alarm, he thumbs frantically through 
the magazine, dropping it once and picking it up with a 
little cry of desperation.
On the second pass through he looks more carefully.
MORT
80, 81, 82 --
He flips to the next page, sees the number on it.
MORT
98
He goes back a page. 82 again. And in the margin is the 
sliced off evidence that pages 83 to 97 have been out out.
MORT
YOU CUT IT OUT!
He BANGS his fist down on the steering wheel, again and again 
and again.
MOST
You out it out, you son of a bitch! 
How did you do that?! You cut it 
out, you cut it out, you cut it 
out!
Mort hears a voice from inside the car, a familiar voice. His 
own voice.
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
How would he do that?
MORT
I don't know. He did it though.
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
Okay.
(pause)
How?
MORT
I DON’T KNOW!
EXT. CABIN - DRIVEWAY - DAY
122
122
100.
The car door opens and Mort climbs out, stepping on a bundle 
of white printed pages right beneath the driver’s window. He 
stalks across the driveway toward the house. The voice 
follows his.
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
It doesn't make sense.
MORT
Shut up.
He winces as an image flickers through his mind:
MORT'S MENTAL IMAGE - MOTEL ROOM
is that same scene from the motel room, the one we've seen 
twice before, his point of view as he races in on Amy and 
Ted, then the camera whips around, sees Mort's face, and it's 
fierce with anger. We see for the first time he's holding 
something in one hand. But before we can see what it is —
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY
123
123
Mort BANGS through the door and drops onto the couch, center 
cushion, arms folded across his chest. Yet again, he finds 
himself face to face with --
— Shooter’s hat. Still sitting on his coffee table, waiting 
for him.
Mort site forward. This time he picks it up. He looks at it 
carefully. And then, for no reason whatsoever and without a 
moments thought —
— he puts it on. He shudders once, the way yon do at a 
mouthful of strong liquor. But that passes. He smooths the 
brim. It fits quite well, actually.
ACROSS THE ROOM
the mirror over the entry table fills with Mort as he stands 
up, hat on his head, and walks forward. He positions himself 
in front of the mirror. The hat completely covers his hair 
and just touches the tops of his ears.
Mort’s Inner Voice speaks up again -- quiet, gently prodding.
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
Why'd you put it on?
MORT
I don't know.
101.
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
... Maybe he wanted you to.
At this moment, we’re looking at Mort straight on. We start 
to move, to creep around him to his right side.
MORT
Why would he want me to put on his 
hat?
INNER VOICE (O.S.)
Maybe he wants you to...
MORT
Yeah?
No answer. We settle into a full profile. Mort turns and 
looks directly at us for the first time.
MORT
Wants me to what?
A face moves in slowly from the side of the frame and 
whispers in Mort's ear -- it's Mort's face. Mort's inner 
voice has been given body, Mort's body. Same guy, same 
clothes. Two Morts, side by side. Talk about talking to 
yourself...
INNER VOICE
... to get confused.
MORT
I'm already confused. Pilgrim.
No sooner is that last word out of his mouth than he wishes 
he could snatch it back out of the air. He whisks Shooter's 
hat off his head and tosses it into a corner.
INNER VOICE
Yeah. Yeah, what about that?
MORT
What about what?
INNER VOICE
"Pilgrim."
Rather than answer, Mort turns and stalks out of the room. We 
go with him (same shot) as he passes the staircase, where his 
Inner Voice is now leaning against the railing.
INNER VOICE
"Shooter's Knob."
102.
Mort reaches the kitchen door but stops, as his Inner Voice 
is already leaning against it.
INNER VOICE
Half a dozen other details you've 
been ignoring.
Mort just stares at him, breathing hard. The Voice takes a 
step forward. They are nose to nose, both suddenly quite 
calm.
INNER VOICE
Are all of these things 
coincidences?
MORT
(defensive)
I'm wearing his bruises, aren’t I?
The Inner Voice doesn’t answer, just holds his eye.
MORT
Aren't I?
INNER VOICE
Are you?
Mort rips his shirt off angrily, rotates his arms out, goes 
to the exact spot where the bruises were yesterday.
But now they’re not there.
MORT
It doesn‘t...
He searches, paws his flesh.
MORT
It doesn't make sense!
INNER VOICE
Would you like to hear something 
that does make sense?
Actually, no, Mort would rather not. He turns and heads for 
the door, reaches for the keys on the hook —
— but the Inner Voice is there ahead of him, leaning against 
the wall next to the hook.
INNER VOICE
Call the police.
103.
Mort turns to the front door but it BANGS shut ahead of him, 
his Inner Voice is leaning against it.
INNER VOICE
Call Dave Newsome and tell him to 
come down here and lock you up.
MORT
If I could get a knife and cut you 
out of me...
He turns away, but the Inner Voice is right behind him.
INNER VOICE
Before you can do any more damage.
MORT
I’m warning you!
He turns again -- Inner Voice is there too. All around him 
now, wherever he turns before he even turns there.
INNER VOICE
Before you kill anyone else.
MORT
I’LL KILL YOU!
But suddenly the Inner Voice is gone, and Mort is standing 
alone in the empty living room, chest heaving, screaming at 
the walls. He holds his head in pain, because here comes 
another mental image, and this one's a doozy:
MORT'S MENTAL IMAGE - MOTEL ROOM
is that shot in the motel room, the startled lovers, the 
enraged husband, Mort holding something, and for the first 
time we see what it is.
A gun.
Held in front of him in a shaking hand, and now we understand 
why Amy and Ted weren't just shocked and embarrassed and 
upset, they were terrified, because Mort is SCREAMING at 
them, RAVING like a lunatic, waving that gun around, shoving 
it between Ted's teeth, snarling and spitting and completely 
out of control.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
125
125
Mort shakes his head to chase away the memory.
MORT
104.
It was unloaded.
The Inner voice is in his ear, it circles him now, walking 
around and around him in ever-tightening circles, always in 
his ear, inches away no matter where Mort turns.
INNER VOICE
Was it?
MORT
Yes!
INNER VOICE
Was it, Mort?
MORT
I told them!
INNER VOICE
Was it really unloaded?
MORT
Amy believed me.
INNER VOICE
You almost killed them. You wanted 
to.
MORT
The gun was NOT loaded!
INNER VOICE
You still want to.
MORT
Shut up!
INNER VOICE
Listen to me. Because this is how 
it happens. This is how it happens 
to people.
MORT
Shut up!
INNER VOICE
There is no John Shooter.
MORT
No!
INNER VOICE
There never has been.
105.
MORT
I do not accept that!
INNER VOICE
You invented him.
MORT
I do not accept that at all!
INNER VOICE
Listen to me, not to him. Before 
it's too late, before you-
MORT
SHUT THZ FUCK UP AND LEAVE ME 
ALONE!
He picks up a heavy ashtray — a dog standing over a large 
marble basin that's supposed to be for the cigarette butts, 
go figure — and hurls it at the Inner Voice as hard as he 
can.
But of course the Inner Voice is gone before Mort even 
releases and the ashtray SMASHES into the wall just over the 
entry table. It puts a large dent in the plaster and opens up 
a crack.
It's a small crack that originates in the middle of the 
crease made by the ashtray. But as Mort watches —
— the crack grows. It creeps all the way up the wall, 
CRUNCHING the plaster apart as it grows. Before Mort's 
wondering ayes, the crack creeps across the ceiling over his 
head, zig-zagging its lightning bolt way right down the 
center of the room, directly above Mort, and finally crawling 
down the far wall, ending in the corner where he has thrown 
Shooter's hat, now resting cock-eyed against the wall.
Mort stands very still in the middle of the room, staring at 
the hat.
MORT
What is happening to me?
He turns around, catches sight of himself in the mirror, and 
GASPS in horror --
— because Shooter's hat is on his head again.
He whips it oft and hurls it across the room. The hat skips 
twice off the floor, and comes to a stop in the doorway of 
the study —
106.
— where John Shooter is leaning against the door jam. He 
picks up the hat and twirls it lightly on one finger, smoking 
a Pall Mall with his free hand.
MORT
(backing away)
You don't exist.
SHOOTER
Oh, I exist, Mr. Rainey.
Mort backs right into the wall. Shooter advances on him.
SHOOTER
I exist because you made me. You 
thought me up. Gave me my name. 
Told me everything you wanted me to 
do.
Mort is horrified, holding his head as the truth pours into 
his consciousness. We see flashes of his thoughts as Shooter 
talks:
EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
126
126
(This image and all the flashback images that follow fly by 
fast, fractured and jarring.)
We're locking through the window of Mort's study again, the 
one at the house in Riverdale, before it burned down. We see 
Shooter‘s shadow on the wall, that crazy hat. But we're 
closer this time, and is a flash of light we see Shooter's 
face below the hat, but of course it isn't Shooter's face at 
all but Mort's face, Mort burned down the house.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
127
127
Shooter is drawing closer.
SHOOTER
You had a job of work needed doing.
EXT. BOWIE'S STORE - DAY
128
128
A shot we haven't seen before, it's morning on Main Street, 
and Ken Kelsch is walking toward the front door of Bowie's 
Store when Mort steps out from a doorway and intercepts him.
KELSCH
Thought we said nine?
107.
MORT
I called Tom. He said to pick him 
up.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
129
129
Shooter's closer still.
SHOOTER
Didn't have the stomach to do it 
yourself. But you knew I did.
INT. GREENLEAF'S CAR - DAY
130
130
Tom Greenleaf, alive again, is driving his Scout, Ken Kelsch 
is in back, Mort is in the passenger seat.
MORT
Right up there, Tom! We were 
standing right there.
GREENLEAF
(sick about this)
I know, Mort, I saw you. I didn’t 
want to say it in front of him --
(jerks a thumb back at 
Kelsch)
— but you were alone.
INT. TOM’S CAR - FLASHBACK - DAY
130A
130A
From Tom's point of view, we're driving down Lake Drive on 
that sunny day. We see a figure up ahead, standing by the 
side of the road — it‘s Mort, standing there by himself. Tom 
waves to him, Mort tips a finger back at him in that 
practiced, country way.
INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY
131
131
Mort laughs disarmingly at Tom's nervousness.
MORT
I know, I can explain. Just pull 
over.
As Greenleaf turns the wheel, we drop down next to Mort's leg 
and see his fingers close around the handle of the hatchet, 
the one that will soon be buried in Ken Kelsch's head.
108.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
132
132
Shooter is right in our face.
SHOOTER
I did them things so you wouldn't 
have to.
EXT. LAKE DRIVE - DAY
133
133
Outside the Scout now, we see Mort whip around from the front 
seat and SMACK the hatchet down in the middle of Ken Kalsch's 
skull. We hear Tom Greenleaf's horrified SHRIEK, but it's 
abruptly cut off as Mort turns to him a split-second later 
and drives the screwdriver home in the middle of his 
forehead.
INT CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
134
134
In the shower in his cabin, Mort cleans up, blood swirls down 
the drain.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY
135
135
Mort awakens, stretches, grabs his arms and back, can’t 
believe how unbelievably sore he is. Now we know why.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
135A
135A
Shooter smiles.
SHOOTER
Offhand, I'd say you're the one 
don't exist. Not anymore. Not 
really.
MORT
What do you want?
SHOOTER
You tell me. Am I done yet? We got 
things all cleaned up around here?
(no answer)
Do we?
MORT
I don't know!
SHOOTER
109.
Think on it. What's the real reason 
I come for?
MORT
Fix your story.
SHOOTER
That's right.
MORT
Fix the ending.
SHOOTER
And how exactly do you suppose you 
oughta do that?
Outside, they hear the sound of tires on gravel. They both 
turn in time —
— to sea Amy's car drive past the front door.
They look at each other.
SHOOTER
"Todd Downey thought that a woman 
who would steal your love when your 
love was really all you had was not 
much of a woman."
Mort takas a step straight forward, but that's where Shooter 
is standing, so when he moves ahead —
— ha passes right through Shooter, whose image falls all to 
pieces, but they’re sticky pieces, and they dissolve and 
cling to Mort at the same time, it’s like walking through a 
spiderweb.
Shooter is gone or maybe Shooter was right, and Mort's the 
one who's gone. Because when Mort finishes Shooter’s 
quotation, he is speaking with Shooter's voice and moving 
with his mannerisms.
He is Shooter.
MORT
"He therefore decided to kill her."
He turns and looks at the mirror again, and from this angle 
he can see the driveway, and Amy's car parked in it. We move 
toward the mirror, fast, than we go through the mirror and 
zoom in on Amy and in that same shot we find ourselves —
EXT. CABIN - DAY
135B
135B
110.
— out in the driveway as Amy SLAMS the door of her car. She 
takes one step and stops, her attention caught by something 
in the driveway.
It’s a sock, Part of it is a rusty red color. Odd. She looks 
up from it.
AMY
Mort?
No answer. She starts walking toward the cabin. Up ahead, 
same white pages are fluttering on the driveway next to 
Mort's car.
She stoops down, picks one up. It’s page 63 of Ellery Queen's 
Mystery Magazine, lying right where Mort dumped it after he 
cut it out of his own magazine.
It's a short story:
SOWING SEASON
Short fiction by Norton Rainey
That’s weird. Amy doesn’t like it. She lets go of the page, 
it flaps away in the light breeze.
Now she really takes in the view of the cabin, and there are 
a few more details that aren’t quite the way we’ve been 
seeing them. The screen door, for example, which is hanging 
from one broken hinge. And a single shoe sitting on the front 
step of the cabin, must go with the sock in the driveway.
Amy passes the garbage cabinet and hears flies BUZZIKG. She 
looks over at the spot where Bump had been pinned to the 
wood.
No Bump, of course, Mort did bury her, but the wood is 
stained, big dark red chunks of dog stuck to it, fliss 
feeding on it.
With a growing sense of alarm, Amy steps up to the screen 
door and peers through.
AMY
Mort?
(no answer)
You home?
Still no answer. She puts a hand on the door —
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY
136
136
111.
— and steps inside. She stops, looking around the room in 
shook.
The outside of the house was a mess, but inside is a 
disaster.
Half-eaten "meals" are on plates around the room, the flies 
are feasting on these too. The ashtray with the dog on it is 
buried in the wall, where it has started a small creek, about 
a foot long. The trash can is full and has overflowed onto 
the floor.
Paper is littered everywhere. It looks as if Mort has exhumed 
every copy of every manuscript he had in the place and strewn 
the pages around, the room.
In short, the room looks nothing like it did two minutes ago, 
when we were looking at it through Mort's eyes. But as we now 
know, those are very unreliable eyes indeed.
Worst of all, everywhere, everywhere is one word. The word is 
SHOOTER.
It's written on the walls in chalk and ink, it's sprayed on 
the window twice in what looks like dried whipped cream — and 
there‘s the Redi-Whip can on the floor under the window to 
prove it.
"Shooter" is written on the stair railings in pencil, neat 
columns stacked on top of each other like addition problems.
It's even carved into the cherry wood coffee table in great 
jagged letters three feet high, like a grotesque declaration 
of love — SHOOTER.
The screwdriver he used to do the carving is lying on the 
tabletop. It's a familiar-looking screwdriver, with a red 
chipped handle, and dried red stuff on its steel shaft. We've 
seen this screwdriver before. Twice.
AMY
(a whisper)
Mort?
She hears a sound. She turns, looks in the direction of Mort' 
study. The door is closed again.
She walks toward it, kicking the issue of Ellery Queen on the 
fleer on the way. She doesn't notice.
She puts a hand on the door to the study and pushes it open.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
138
138
112.
The door swings wide and Amy takes a step into the study. The 
first thing she notices is Mort's computer monitor, which has 
been swept off the desk and is lying on its side on the 
floor, where it imploded.
On the desk in its place is an old Royal typewriter. A typed 
manuscript is neatly stacked on top of it. Amy takes a quick 
look around the room and walks toward it --
-- passing Mort, who is standing just behind the door, hands 
folded primly behind his back, Shooter's hat perched atop his 
head.
She doesn't notice. And he doesn’t move. Amy crosses the room 
to the desk and comes around behind it, peering down at the 
manuscript. The title page is on top:
Secret Window, Secret Garden
By John Shooter
Amy stares at it, puzzled.
AMY
(a mutter)
John Shooter... ?
She looks up and sees "Shooter" is also written on the walls 
of this room, across the walls in a nearly straight line. She 
follows the line, but as she nears the end of it, the last 
one doesn’t say "Shooter" anymore, somehow it has evolved 
into two words, two words that are right over Mort's head:
SHOOT HER
Amy GASPS, seeing Mort and the words at the same time.
She's scared as hall, tries to sound normal, fails.
AMY
Hi.
He doesn't reply, just stares at her.
She looks at the hat.
AMY
Where'd you find that old thing? 
The attic?
He still doesn't answer, but his face twitches, and as it 
twitches, we saw a thought that flashes through his mind:
113.
EXT. RUMMAGE SALE - DAY
139
139
Mort, younger, is at a rummage sale in the country with Amy. 
He puts the hat on, turns around to face her, smiling. He 
affects a Southern accent, sounds just like Shooter.
MORT
Time to plant the north forty, 
ma'am.
INT. CABIN - STUDY - DAY
140
140
The flinch goes away as Mort banishes the memory. He smiles. 
A Shooter smile. He speaks softly, as Shooter.
MORT
It's my hat. Wasn't ever anybody 
else’s.
AMY
Mort? What’s wrong? What's-
MORT
You got you a wrong number, woman. 
Ain't no Mort here. Mort’s dead. He 
did a lot of squirmin' around, but 
in the end he couldn’t lie to 
himself anymore, let alone to me. I 
never put a hand on him, Mrs. 
Rainey. I swear. He took the 
coward's way out.
Amy looks around the room. One door, and Mort's standing 
right next to it.
AMY
Why are you talking that way?
MORT
This is just the way I talk. 
Everybody down in Miss’ippi talks 
this way.
AMY
Mort, stop it!
MOST
Don't you understand what I said? 
You ain’t deaf, are you? He's dead. 
He killed himself.
AMY
(starting to cry)
114.
You're scaring me...
MORT
Don't matter.
He takes his hands out from behind his back. In one of them 
he holds a pair of scissors.
MORT
(walking toward her)
You won't be scared long.
She stays still for a moment, in total disbelief, but then 
snaps out of it. She bolts for the door.
Mort lunges toward her, bringing the scissors down in a 
silver arc --
— but his foot slips on the loose papers on the floor and he 
falls, missing her by a few inches. The blades stab into the 
hardwood floor, right through page nine of "Secret Window, 
Secret Garden."
Mort's mouth BANGS oft the floor and sprays blood. A half-
smoked package of Pall Malls shoots out of his shirt pocket 
and slides across the wooden floor.
Mort yanks the scissors from the floor and gets up on his 
knees, smiling and snarling through the blood running over 
his lips and teeth.
MORT
Won't do you no help, Mr. Rainey!
He checks the scissors, seas their blunted tips, and tosses 
them impatiently aside as he gets to his feet.
MORT
I got a place for you! I got it all 
picked out!
He walks out the door after her.
EXT. CABIN - DRIVEWAY - DAY
142
142
Amy races dews the front steps of the cabin and to her car. 
She throws open the door and leaps inside, SLAMMING down the 
locks.
Through the passenger window, we see Mort walk calmly out of 
the house after her. She fumbles for her keys, pawing for the 
right one.
115.
Mort walks toward the car, bending down when he gets near it, 
just out of our sight, below the window line.
Amy jams the key in the ignition —
— Mort stands up next to the passenger window —
— Any turns the key and the engine ROARS to life --
— and Mort SMASHES the boulder he picked up through the 
passenger window.
To Amy's credit, she doesn't scream, doesn't let herself get 
distracted. She reaches over for the gear shift (it's a stick 
shift) and starts to jam it into reverse.
But Mort lunges through the window and grabs hold of that 
hand, gets her hard by the wrist. Amy fights him, shoves the 
car into reverse anyway.
The car starts to move, but Mort's half in it, and he's got 
both hands on her now.
Amy shoves a foot down on the gas, Mort pulls her with all 
his strength —
— and hauls her right out through the broken passenger window 
as the car rolls away.
Now Amy SCREAMS as her legs rake over the jagged broken glass 
in the window frame. She THUDS to the ground on the gravel 
driveway as her car rolls in a broad, backward semi-circle, 
SLAMMING ass-end into a tree and coming to a stop.
INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY
143
143
Mort BANGS through the screen door of the cabin, dragging Amy 
behind him, a firm grip on her hair. She's half-crawling, 
trying to stop him or at least keep up, it hurts like hell.
Mort reaches the coffee table and grabs the screwdriver, the 
one he used on the dog and Tom Greenleaf.
MORT
(still Shooter)
Be still, will you.
He knocks her over onto her back, raises the screwdriver, and 
brings it down. Amy SHRIEKS and rolls away --
-- but the screwdriver buries in her calf. Now she SCREAKS.
116.
He pulls the blade cut and she rolls over, crawling away from 
him fast.
MORT
No, ma'am.
He grabs her by the ankle.
MORT
No, ma'am.
Amy swings her other leg around hard and connects with his 
nose, breaking it with a wet SNAP.
He turns and looks back at her as blood runs down his lip.
MORT
I'm about done fussin' with you.
She drags herself to her feet and races toward the back door.
Her right loafer, filling with blood, SQUELCHES and SMOOCHES 
on her foot.
She hits the screen door with both hands --
EXT. CABIN - LAKE SIDE - DAY
144
144
-- and staggers out into the back yard. Mort flies out the 
door behind her and SLAMS into her; a hard tackle. She hits 
the ground on her stomach, all his weight on her, and the air 
WHOOSHES out of her.
Mort climbs off of her and flips her over. She's GASPING, the 
wind knocked out of her, unable to breathe for the moment, 
certainly unable to stand.
Mort gets up, looks around --
— and grabs the shovel out of the pile of dirt in the back 
yard.
MORT
I am sorry, Missus. None of this 
was my idea. It was Mr. Rainey all 
along.
AMY
(desperate for air)
Mort...
MORI
117.
'Cause right is right. And fair is 
fair.
He comes over and straddles her, holding the shovel in both 
hands.
AMY
You are...
MORT
And something has got to be done.
AMY
You are Mort Rainey...
MORT
I got a place for you.
He hefts the shovel.
AMY
You are Mort Rainey.
MORT
I get it all picked out.
He raises the shovel over his head, about to bring it down on 
her.
AMY
YOU ARE MORT RAINEY!
Mort pauses. (If we're listening carefully at this point, we 
might have just heard car tires on gravel.)
AMY
YOU ARE MORT RAINEY! YOU ARE MORT 
RAINEY!
Mort's brow furrows. The shovel levers, slightly at first. 
Amy's tone changes, becomes aura soothing, she’s trying like 
hell.
AMY
You are Mort Rainey. Your name is 
Mort Rainey.
The shovel lowers even more, Mort's thinking like crazy now, 
even cocking his head like a dog.
AMY
Say it. Your name. Mort Rainey.
118.
The shovel lowers even more, he's holding it across his waist 
now. Is this it? Has she done it? Have her words reached him?
At that very moment, we hear THUNDERING FEET inside the 
house, we see the outline of a man racing through the house, 
he calls out a name, we recognize the voice —
TED (O.S.)
AMY?!
— and the back screen doer BANGS open and Ted comes barreling 
outside, just in time to meet —
— MORT'S SHOVEL, which he brings across his chest in a two 
hundred and seventy degree baseball swing that catches Ted 
full in the face.
No. Amy’s words did not reach Mort.
He was just listening.
Ted flies off his feet and lands on his back on the stairs, 
SNAPPING two vertebrae.
Amy SCREAMS. She watches as, in a flash, Mort is standing 
over Ted, raising the shovel again, this time like a long-
handled axe over his head, and he brings it down on Ted's 
head.
We don't see the death blow, but Ted's head sounds pretty 
much as you'd think it would, like an overripe watermelon.
Amy SCREAMS one more time, for good measure. Mort turns to 
her, in no mood to fuck around any longer, he walks toward 
her and raises the shovel up over his head and hesitates, 
just holding it up there, over his head, deciding whether or 
not to end this thing, and in that instant of indecision 
everything goes
BLACK.

Downtown Tashmore Lake on a lovely fall day, The leaves have 
changed, so a few months must have gone by. Mort's Buick 
parks in front of Bowie's Store.
Mort climbs out and heads into the store, WHISTLING. Two 
women, the same two woman who watched him when he came out of 
the post office with the Fed Ex package, stop where they are 
on the sidewalk as he approaches.
MORN
119.
'Morning, ladies!
The Women stare. The First Woman whispers something to the 
Second Woman. This time, the second woman does not laugh. 
They are afraid of him, he’s O.J. in Brentwood.

Mort breezes inside.
MORT
Hiya, Gerda1
Gerda doesn’t look at him, doesn't answer. The entire place 
tenses.
Mort heads for the back counter, not the diner part, but the 
store part. As he passes the usual Department of Public Works 
guys having their breakfast at the counter, they turn their 
heads, one by one. After he passes. Not before. There is no 
eye contact this time.
AT THE BACK
Mort cheerily picks a few items off the shelves, brings them 
over to the counter as Gerda meets him reluctantly at the 
register.
MORT
No time for breakfast today, I'm 
afraid.
Gerda rings up the items. There's butter. Morton Salt. A 
stack of napkins.
Gerda never looks at him.
GERDA
Six twenty-six.
Mort PLUNKS down a ten.
MORT
How's business?
Gerda hands him his change, finally looks him in the eye.
GERDA
Been better.
MORT
120.
Ah, it'll pick up. Always does. "To 
everything there is a season." 
Thanks, Gerda!
He takes his bag and leaves. Gerda watches him go.
CUT TO:
EXT. CABIN - DAY

147
Mort's cabin, Mort's Buick parked in front. The trees 
changing color. You know, this place is just absolutely 
beautiful.
A police car rolls slowly into the driveway. "Tashmore Lake 
Sheriff's Department" on the side.
INT. CABIH - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The back door opens and Mort comes into the cabin from the 
back, carrying a basket of something from outside.
DAVE NEWSOME
(through the screen)
Mr. Rainey?
Mort jumps, startled. Ha smiles when he recognizes Newsom.
MORT
Dave! You startled me.
DAVE NEWSOME
May I came in?
MORT
Uh... can you come back? I'm a 
little busy right now.
DAVE NEWSOME
'Fraid not. Mr. Rainey. Official 
visit.
But without another word, Mort just turns and walks Into the 
kitchen, carrying his basket.
Dave is surprised. He opens the screen door and comes inside.
He hears a bumping end CLANGING from the kitchen and walks 
slowly toward the swinging door.
He pushes it open.
121.

One hand still on the door, Newsome gradually reveals the 
view into the kitchen. The piece is a foul, fetid mess. There 
are stacks of rotting corn husks everywhere, a huge pot 
boiling on the stove.
Mort chucks the basket he wee carrying into a corner of the 
kitchen beside two others. It's full of freshly picked ears 
of corn.
Newsome looks around, shocked. Mort's at the stove now, 
putting on hot pads to remove the boiling pot.
MORT
Told you, Dave, I’m kinda swamped.
He carries the pot over to the sink and dumps it into a large 
strainer there. The boiling water and bright yellow ears of 
corn tumble out and steam billows up over Mort's head in a 
great hot cloud.
MORT
Harvest time.
DAVE NEWSOME
So I see.
Mort pulls off the hot pads and plucks the still-steaming 
ears of corn from the trainer, placing them in a bowl one by 
one.
Pause, then out with it:
DAVE NEWSOME
We finally found Tom Greenleaf's 
car. Seems it was at the bottom of 
Dunsmoor Quarry.
Mort doesn't answer, just carries the bowl of corn to the 
table and has a seat.
DAVE NEWSOME
And old Tom was in it, along with 
another body. Too decayed to 
identify right off, but I got a 
hunch it’s gonna turn out to be 
that private investigator you hired 
down in the city. But I expect you 
knew that already.
Mort still doesn't answer. He picks an ear of corn and jabs 
two of those prongy corn-eater things into the ends. Easier 
to eat that way, you don't get your fingers messy.
122.
DAVE HEWSOME
And we found a wristwatch in the 
car, too. I don’t think there's e 
soul in town has any doubt it's 
gonna turn out to be yours. Not 
with that inscription. Yeah, you 
had us running in circles for a few 
months there, I'll give you that. 
We may never find what you did with 
the body of your wife and Ted 
Milner, but we got enough now.
Mort slathers some butter over the hot ear of corn, it melts 
and drips onto the plate.
DAVE NEWSOME
There's a half dozen fellas from 
the FBI on their way up here right 
now to put you under arrest. Should 
be there in three or four minutes. 
I just wanted to tell you myself.
Mort sprinkles salt on the corn.
DAVE NEWSOME
Did you hear what I said? You’re 
going to jail, Mr. Rainey, and you 
won't be coming out.
MORT
Oh, I’m not worried about that. The 
only thing that matters is the 
ending. He was right to push me on 
it. It's the most important part of 
a story, the ending.
He looks up at the Sheriff, his face full of the modest pride 
of craftsmanship.
MORT
I think I got it right this time. A 
perfect ending.
He holds the ear of corn up in front of him, studies the 
shiny yellow kernels, the beautiful oozing butter, the bright 
white flakes of salt. He recites from memory, in Shooter's 
voice:
MORT
123.
"I know I can do it," Todd Downey 
said, helping himself to another 
ear of corn from the steaming bowl. 
“I'm sure that in time every bit of 
her will be gone and her death will 
be a mystery. Even to me.”
He leans forward to take a bite, clearing our line of vision, 
and we notice something waving outside his kitchen window.
Corn stalks.
We drift toward the waving green stalks, across the kitchen, 
out the open window —
EXT. HOUSE - LAKE SIDE - DAY

— and into the middle of the garden. Once a bare patch of 
dirt, it's now full of seven foot corn stalks, their tassels 
CLICKING against one another in the light breeze.
We keep drifting, but down now, down the lengths of the 
stalks, dawn where the irregular shafts of sunlight barely 
strike, past the base of the stalks, down to the dirt and 
then into the dirt, still moving, underground now, following 
the roots of the corn stalks into the moist black earth.
They go deep, these roots, thick at first, then thinner, 
thinner still, we're six feet underground now and still 
following the spidery tendrils of corn root down, past the 
corpse of Bump the dog, all the way down —
— into the decomposing bodies of Amy Rainey and her lover.

MORT
Perfect.
CRUNCH!
Mort sinks his teeth into the corn and tears the kernels 
free, butter running down his chin.
FADE OUT.
