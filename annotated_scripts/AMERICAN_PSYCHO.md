::SCRIPT::
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged silk curtains, hand written menus and pale pink tablecloths decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaia, Armani power suits.

  LINE: ...with goat cheese profiteroles and I also have-an.arugula Caesar salad. For entrees tonight I have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

  LINE: PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing expensively cut suits, suspenders, slicked back hair. Van Patten wears horn rimmed glasses. The-camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

  LINE: We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California place on the Upper East side.
  EXPRESSION: Observational
- CHARACTER: Narrator
  LINE: The waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman' s description of each of the men at the table.
  EXPRESSION: null
- CHARACTER: Patrick Bateman
  LINE: You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress...

  EXPRESSION: Inquisitive

  LINE: Or can it be worn with a suit?
  EXPRESSION: Prompting
- CHARACTER: McDermott
  LINE: Exactly.
  EXPRESSION: Smiling
- CHARACTER: Patrick Bateman
  LINE: With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would call for a bolder vest.
  EXPRESSION: Instructive
- CHARACTER: McDermott
  LINE: But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied.
  EXPRESSION: Instructive
- CHARACTER: Van Patten
  LINE: You think so?
  EXPRESSION: Skeptical

  LINE: You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
  EXPRESSION: Judgmental

  EXPRESSION: Agreeing

  LINE: Did he just take our plates away?
  EXPRESSION: Staring

  LINE: He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished. God I hate this place. This is a chick's restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I killed another girl with a chainsaw - I had to, she almost got away. There was someone else there, maybe a model, I can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here... I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40 - I have tapes of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I just, well I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not sure I'm going to get away with it this time - I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So - if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar so, you know, keep your eyes open.
