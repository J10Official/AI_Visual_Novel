# Idea Fragments

- **Motivation:** Humor generation semeval task after talks with orgnizer
- **Principle:** LLM arbitrary at scoring, great at comparisons (demonstrated by using both strategies on some text (out of dataset) and showing comparison is better than scoring to match with real world)
- **Strategy:** Contest using the DSA algo (TGC gamedev), top 3 best selected
- **Idea:** creativity is relative and not absolute, focus on comparison rather than scores
- Write code, reference relevant literature.
