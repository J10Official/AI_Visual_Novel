[NARRATION] The woodcutter is just coming out of the cabin when his eyes fall on the pond again. Something strange catches them. He walks to the edge.
[NARRATION - Curious] The small pond of water is filled with a lot of bioluminescent water-weeds - the kind found by the swamp. The water is crystal clear. The pond is strangely still.
[NARRATION] He bends down and brushes some of the long stalks... The water s**s**s...
[NARRATION] To his surprise, the leaves of an underwater lily plant move.
[NARRATION] He stares into the water.
[NARRATION - Disbelieving] Then to his shock: A GIANT GHOUL-LIKE GREEN BEAST, as tall as his small house, emerges!
