[NARRATION] The pond is in the very middle of the woods. The water shimmers, the reeds sway in the breeze.
[NARRATION] The woodcutter walks to the pond and stops, looking at it. He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
Woodcutter (Determined): I’m going to do it. I’m going to make it.
[NARRATION] He walks to the pond and starts digging with his shovel.
[NARRATION] After a while, he looks up at the sky. The sun is setting.
[NARRATION] He continues to dig, and soon a large, round hole is formed in the middle of the pond. The earth is piled in front of a thin, narrow passage that leads into the middle of the pond.
