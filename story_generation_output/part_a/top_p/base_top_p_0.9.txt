You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a **dystopian science-fiction story**.

**Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:**
* **Setting:** A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* **The 'Shoemaker':** He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* **The 'Elves':** They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* **The 'Shoes':** The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* **Tone:** The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* **Ending:** The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

The neon glare of Neo-London bled onto the cracked, metal streets. It was a city built on chrome and sweat, where the air itself tasted metallic. Here, they judged you not by your words, but by the gleam of your augmented limbs – the finer the bio-weave, the higher your social standing. 

Elias, a man with a face like a weathered leather boot and hands calloused from years of tinkering, was an outlier. He lived on the fringe, his tiny workshop tucked between rusting industrial plants and the city's underbelly.  He wasn't an assembler, a technician, or a maker. Elias was a sculptor, a craftsman of flesh and chrome, a shadow in the metropolis's blinding glare. He repaired and built custom bio-mechanical limbs for those deemed unfit for the city’s rigid, metallic embrace.

In the hushed hours, when the city’s neon pulse faded into the background hum, Elias would leave his work on the workbench – discarded, discarded limbs, shimmering with untapped potential. It was in these hours, when the city slept, that he received his secret visitors. Not in the form of the grotesque, monstrous beings of legend, but in the whispers of an ancient truth – a whisper that haunted the city’s darkest corners, a whisper about the "Elves." 

The "Elves," whispered the shadows, were more than just rumors. They were a swarm of self-replicating nanobots, a silent, tireless collective. They lived in the city's rusted veins, burrowing into metal, embedding themselves in flesh, building the city’s underbelly, one bio-hack at a time.

It wasn't a legend. It wasn't a myth. It was the truth, whispered by the city's own dust motes. And Elias, with his worn hands and his weathered soul, felt the truth seep into his bones. It was in these moments of the truth, as he worked, that he saw it. He saw them.

It started with a faint hum, a vibration that emanated from the discarded limb that had been left on the workbench overnight. He reached out to touch it, but found nothing. There was just a hum, a pulsating energy field, and an inexplicable feeling of warmth. The limb, bathed in the soft glow of the city's streetlights, seemed to flicker with life.

Then, as if summoned by some unseen hand, it came alive, a tiny, almost invisible cluster of glowing blue particles taking shape. They were not metallic elves, not winged sprites. These were nanobots.  Tiny, intricate beings, a microscopic symphony of programmed perfection. 

They pulsed around the limb, a gentle, almost hypnotic flow. They were building something, something that Elias had never seen before. They were weaving in and out of the bio-mechanicals, a complex web of threads of light and energy, stitching together an impossibly intricate symphony of upgrade. 

Elias watched in awe as the nanobots sculpted the limb, their movements slow and deliberate, precise and beautiful. It was like a dance, a silent, invisible ballet. 

When the final pulse faded, the limb, no longer a discarded relic but a work of art, hummed with an energy that almost seemed sentient. Elias looked back at his workbench. A single charging plate, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, was left on its surface, a testament to the power he hadn’t known he possessed, and to the secrets he hadn’t dared to seek. 

Elias, eyes fixed on the charged plate, a faint, barely perceptible smile creasing his weathered face, whispered, "Thank you." 

The nanobots, silent and unseen, pulsed in
