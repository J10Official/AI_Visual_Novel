You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a **dystopian science-fiction story**.

**Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:**
* **Setting:** A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* **The 'Shoemaker':** He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* **The 'Elves':** They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* **The 'Shoes':** The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* **Tone:** The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* **Ending:** The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

The City of Neon was a labyrinth of steel and shadow, its neon glare a cruel mockery of the sun that dared not touch these rusted heavens. Every citizen, their cybernetic modifications glowing like a morbid display of artificial life, was judged by their augmentations, their worth measured in the hum of their processors, their value determined by the glow of their bio-luminescent skin.  At its heart, the City's pulse was the Black Market, a sprawling network of alleyways and clandestine dens where the desperate traded in stolen dreams and forbidden technologies.

Amongst the grime and the shadows, lived Silas, a man whose hands were more akin to weathered wood than the cold steel of the city's elite. He was a Shoemaker, a title earned not for the leather he crafted, but for the intricate bio-mechanical limbs he built. He worked in the shadows, a recluse in a dingy workshop, his workshop a refuge from the suffocating judgment of the City.  Silas wasn't a criminal, he was a craftsman, but his work was forbidden - he repaired and built custom limbs for the outcasts, those deemed unworthy by the city's rigid code. 

Every night, the workshop would become a cathedral of mechanical wonders, the air thick with the scent of ozone and the hum of a million tiny gears.  He worked in silence, his weathered hands wielding tools of ancient, forgotten magic, transforming the broken and mangled into the functional. He'd leave them on a workbench, waiting to be claimed by the city's underbelly, and every night, a miracle would unfold. The limbs weren't just repaired - they were upgraded. 

The City's elite scoffed at the notion of such miracles. "It's just a fabrication," they'd murmur, their augmented eyes filled with derision. "A myth - the Elven Craftsmen." They called them legends, whispers of a forgotten past, stories told by the drunkards and the desperate. They believed the stories were just that - stories.

Silas did not believe in myth. He felt the whisper of the impossible as fingers danced across the metal, fingers that could feel the pulse of a thousand volts. He'd seen the metal shift and warp in response to the hum of his tools, felt the air crackle with the energy of the unseen, the hum of nanobots, microscopic creatures that were said to be the stuff of dreams. 

He'd feel the faintest whisper of a consciousness, a flicker of thought in the dark recesses of the metal. He'd find his tools humming to life in the dead of the night, the glow of his workbench illuminating a web of intricate nanotechnology. He'd see the limbs he'd left on the workbench transform, the metal breathing, pulsing, moving with a life of its own. And when he woke the next morning, the limbs would be as they were.

Silas had seen the city's elite, their cybernetics gleaming under the neon lights, their limbs perfect in their precision. But he saw the city's underbelly, the ones who lived on the fringes of society, their limbs warped, their bodies twisted, their skin scarred and worn, a constant reminder of the City's unforgiving code.

He watched as the nanobot swarm, a silent dance of light and shadow, their metallic bodies weaving in and out of the metal, their intricate network of pathways glowing like tiny stars. He saw them transform, their metallic bodies shifting and reforming, their forms constantly changing in response to the hum of the City. With each passing night, the limbs he left on the workbench would begin to glow, the metal becoming a canvas for a thousand tiny lights.

Silas never knew what he was
