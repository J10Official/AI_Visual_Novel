You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Dream Merchant's Workshop
model
The year is 2242. This ramshackle workshop, located in the grimy underbelly of the city, is hardly visible in the towering, metallic buildings. The old master, a small, hunched man with grey eyes like a startled hawk, lives amidst a chaotic array of tools and half-finished projects. Tools are strapped to one knee, wires of copper gleam amidst the steel. His calloused hands and tired frame are held together by an iron-forged belt with an ornate buckle attached to a worn sack of cloth worn on his back. He is constantly working, tinkering and refitting with the utmost secrecy, and the city's shadows follow him. His workshop is where he dreams. In the dark of night, his mind races with the most complex and secret of scientific dreams. The kind that is forbidden in this city. His most secret project is to design, to create and to install in this city’s black market, the most advanced prostheses the world has never seen...
Here - in his workshop - there are others.
Here exist the best artisans this city has to offer.model
Narrator: He never leaves it, not day and not night.
