You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

# The Shoemaker and the Nanobots
[Narrator]: On this day, a nameless servant brings a bundle of new cloth to the shop.
[Narrator]: The servant is struck dumb with fear.
[Narrator]: He looks to the blacksmith in charge of the forge. The blacksmith looks to the servant with disdain.
[Narrator]: The servant looks again at the bundle. “Master, these are the finest silks in all of the city!”
[Narrator]: The blacksmith sighs, and turns back to his craft.
[Narrator]: The servant leaves the blacksmith and returns to his master.
[Narrator]: A whisper of a thought fills his mind... “She likes these. Let me do something.”
\
[Narrator]: Two hours later.
[Narrator]: A large package has been placed on a table.
[Narrator]: In the package, three pairs of shoes.

[Narrator]: The servant enters his master’s workshop, which is filled with leather, metal and hammers.
[Narrator]: He places the shoes in a box.
[Narrator]: The master, with gloves on, picks up each shoe.
[Narrator]: He is not in the mood for conversation.
[Narrator]: The servant stands and waits.

[Narrator]: The master walks over the box and puts a hammer on top. Then he drops a pin and hammer blows it flat to make a small, thin space on top of the box...
[Narrator]: The servant is puzzled. 

[Narrator]: The master opens the box, he places his work glove over the pin.
[Narrator]: It is time... 
[Narrator]: As the work glove touches the pin, a bolt flies out that was meant for a piece of metal to be hammered to work on.
[Narrator]: A pin hits the end of the glove of metal and the metal flies off of the top of the box. ...The master has just killed the servant!
[Narrator]: The servant stands still in the air before falling to the ground, dead.
[Narrator]: The master throws a shoe out of the box. He looks at it and says, “He is dead.”
\
[Narrator]: Two days later.
[Narrator]: The master sits in his chair looking at a single shoe on its heel. He puts down his tools and examines his work. 
[Narrator]: He is fascinated, he has a new mystery on his hands. He picks up his tools and prepares to begin his work on the shoes. 
[Narrator]: He throws the shoe into his workshop. 
[Narrator]: He has left his tools in their place: his hammer, tongs, his anvil and his anvil.
[Narrator]: The shoes look like any ordinary shoes.
[Narrator]: The master picks them up and examines them. He opens and closes them.
[Narrator]: The nanobots are moving and humming.
[Narrator]: The master opens his box. He has found a needle and thread – but they have been there for years, untouched! He has never used them before!
[Narrator]: He examines the tiny needle. He has never seen a needle this small in his life!
[Narrator]: As he examines the needle, more and more nanobots arrive in his workshop. They are alive and well. This is like magic! He can't believe it! 
\
[Narrator]: Days pass. It is night.
[Narrator]: He has found more of them in the box...
[Narrator]: He looks at them, mesmerized.
\
[Narrator]: He throws the needle on the table, and the nanobots land on the top!
[Narrator]: He pulls out a needle... and places the nanobots on it. The nanobots work!
[Narrator]: This is how he made the shoes for himself. He knew that he was right to think the nanobots were real. 
[Narrator]: They made them on the needles! It was magical! He was happy to have discovered them.
\
[Narrator]: As he works, his heart races in his chest like a bird.
[Narrator]: He is no longer sad, he feels joy.
[Narrator]: He is alive, he is strong, he is free! He can do anything!
[Narrator]: He can create his own magic! He can create a new life for himself!
