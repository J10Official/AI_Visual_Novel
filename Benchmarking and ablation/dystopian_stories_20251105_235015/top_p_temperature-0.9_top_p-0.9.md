You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker
He is a reclusive old craftsman. He lives in a dingy attic room in a dilapidated building. He is obsessed with bio-mechanical limb upgrades for the disabled.

He works in his workshop late into the night. He knows he is an outcast, but he refuses to be a cog in the city's mechanised machine. He works on custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts, repairing them at night in his dark, cluttered workshop. The city is obsessed with its new, perfect, bio-mechanical enhancements. But they can be quite expensive. His modified limbs are his own creation.

One night, he is working on a prosthetic leg for a young girl with a mangled leg. He works meticulously, his face illuminated by the glow of his soldering iron. Suddenly, he sees an anomaly on his workbench – a cluster of microscopic, nano-sized organisms. He stares, fascinated. These tiny, silvery-grey organisms move across his workbench with a whirring sound. Their movements are impossible. He has never seen anything like this before.

He studies them. He knows that they are something quite extraordinary. The microorganism swarm is not merely working on his limbs; they are building them from scratch, with an impossible efficiency. They build new, improved versions of the bio-mechanical limb overnight. He is astonished. He has been studying the natural world for his entire life. He has never seen anything like this before. He feels a thrill of excitement and fear.
