You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

[NARRATION] The year is 2242. The city of New Berlin is a labyrinth of steel and concrete, a hive of industry and despair. The streets are teeming with the downtrodden, their bodies augmented with cybernetic implants, their souls as chipped and broken as their metal.

[NARRATION] In a dingy workshop, a man named Thomas, a craftsman of the old world, works on a pair of custom-made prosthetic limbs for a young girl. He is a recluse, shunned by the city’s elite, yet his work is renowned. His workshop is a sanctuary of forgotten crafts, a refuge from the city’s cold, sterile embrace.

[NARRATION] He is a man of quiet dignity, his face etched with the lines of a life lived in the shadow of the city’s relentless march. His hands are calloused, his eyes are weary, but his heart is kind.
