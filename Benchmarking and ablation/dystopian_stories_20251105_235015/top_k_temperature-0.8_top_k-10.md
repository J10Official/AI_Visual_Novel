You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker
He has no name. He is simply known to his friends as “Old Man Smith”, and to the public as “The Shoemaker”. He is a recluse who lives in a cramped attic apartment with an enormous workshop in which he crafts intricate, often illegal, bio-mechanical prostheses for the city’s outcasts. He is a man of few words, but his work speaks for him.
He is obsessed by his craft, working tirelessly day and night. His workshop is a labyrinth of metal, gears, and wires, a testament to his genius and the source of his loneliness.model
## Night
The streetlamps illuminate the alleyways of the city. A shadow emerges from the darkness of the alley.
