You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

[Narrator] The year is 2242. The city of New Jerusalem is a sprawling, grimy metropolis. Its citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements. The most advanced are the “Orpheus” – the elite with their advanced bio-mechanical limbs. The least advanced are the “Orphans” – the outcasts with their crude, ill-fitting limbs.
[Narrator] The “Orphans” are the “undesirables” of the city. They are forced to live in the shadows of the city, in the dark underbelly where the “Orpheus” do not dare to tread. They are the forgotten, the lost, the outcast.
