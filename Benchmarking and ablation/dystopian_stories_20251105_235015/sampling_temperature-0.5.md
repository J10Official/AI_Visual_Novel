You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

# The Shoemaker

The old craftsman is a recluse. He lives in a dingy, cramped apartment above his workshop in the bowels of the city. It is a place of shadows and shadows only. A place where he can commune with his craft and his muse. He is a master artisan, a tinker, an engineer, a dreamer.

He is also a thief.model
# The Thief

He steals the discarded limbs of the city’s elite, the cybernetically enhanced. He repairs them with his own hands, and he makes them better. He makes them stronger. He makes them more efficient. He makes them more beautiful.

He is not a criminal. He is a craftsman. He is an artist. He is a lover of life. He is a lover of beauty. He is a lover of the world.
