You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

The street is dark, damp, and dusty. Rain pours down. The old man, a craftsman in his late sixties, walks home from work. He is a tired, miserable man. His clothes are stained and dirty. He lives in a small, cramped room with a single window. His face is weathered, his hair is grey, and his eyes are tired.

He passes a street urchin selling newspapers. He buys one. The news is about a riot in the Lower District. He knows he shouldn’t read it. He knows they will be coming for him. He knows that he must stay hidden. He knows that he must be ready.

He is alone. His wife, Ellen, died years ago. He has no children. The only family he has are his hands – his two hands – his tools – his shop – his workbench – his home – his life. He is afraid. He is tired. He is lonely. He is a good man.

He goes to his workbench in his small, cramped room. He opens the door and goes inside. There are tools everywhere – hammers, chisels, saws, screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, screwdrivers, and more. He knows he must go to his shop. He knows he must go to his workbench. He knows he must go to his home.

He goes to his workbench. He opens the door. He goes inside. He is alone.
