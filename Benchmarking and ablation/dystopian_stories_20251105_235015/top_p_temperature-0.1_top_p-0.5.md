You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

[NARRATION] The year is 2242. The city of New Berlin is a labyrinth of steel and concrete, a hive of industry and despair. The citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements. The most advanced are the elite, the rest are the “unmodified”.
[NARRATION] In the shadows of the city, lives a reclusive old craftsman, a man of the old world. He is called the Shoemaker. He is a master of his craft, a man of the past. He lives in a small, cluttered workshop, where he repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts. He is a man of few words, but his eyes hold a deep sadness.
[NARRATION] He is obsessed with the legend of the Elves, a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth. He believes they are the key to his ultimate goal: to create a perfect, bio-mechanical limb.
[NARRATION] He works late into the night, his workshop filled with the whirring of his tools. He is a man of the past, but he is also a man of the future. He is a man of science, but he is also a man of faith. He believes that the Elves are real, and that they are the key to his ultimate goal.
