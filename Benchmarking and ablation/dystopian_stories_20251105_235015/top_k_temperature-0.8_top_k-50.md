You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

# THE SHOEMAKER
[NARRATOR] The year is 2242. Our protagonist is a gruff old craftsman named Thomas, who lives in poverty in New Vienna. His bio-mechanics make him almost invisible.
[NARRATION] He works for a sweatshop on the docks and gets by. But he has a secret, which terrifies him—he was once a renowned scientist. Now, he secretly rebuilds and re-programs bio-mechanicals for the city’s outcastes, hiding his work beneath his old shoemaking shop.
[NARRATION] Thomas is plagued by a recurring dream: he sees the shadow of a towering, elegant, tall, and beautiful woman with long, dark hair, who is wearing a high-necked, long-sleeved white gown of the finest silk. She whispers to him, “The Nanobots are coming.” And then she vanishes. He dismisses this as madness. But now, he sees them in his dreams again, and they are becoming more frequent.
[NARRATION] He’s obsessed with finding out what these Nanobots are. He has been having visions of them ever since he was a child, and feels they are somehow related to his father, a former professor of experimental physics. His father always spoke of them, a “race of the impossible,” which he had been studying, but had been murdered in the year 1942, as was his lab.
[NARRATION] Thomas dreams of them, both his parents’ obsession, and an unspeakable, dark presence. Thomas has become obsessed with them.
[NARRATION] He is certain a scientific breakthrough, and that they are out of control. He knows this because he cannot get them out of his head. He dreams of them, their dark, beautiful eyes, and their terrifying, hypnotic gaze. He has become obsessed with them.
[NARRATION] The nanobots are now everywhere in his dreams, and they are becoming more frequent.
[NARRATION] Thomas is losing his mind, and he knows that his obsession is turning into madness. He has become so obsessed with them that he has lost all his friends and is no longer able to work. He has become a recluse, living in his father’s old laboratory.
[NARRATION] He has finally found the key to the nanobots: there is a tiny, almost microscopic, microchip embedded in the root of the nanomotor. It is a tiny, pulsating, metallic, heart-shaped chip.
[NARRATION] Thomas knows the nanobots are coming. He knows they will soon break free of his control and have free reign over the city! He knows that the nanobots hold the key to all his family’s scientific breakthroughs, and that he must stop them before they take over. He has become obsessed with finding the nanobots and must find a way to control them.
[NARRATION] He has finally found the key to the nanobots: there is a tiny, almost microscopic, microchip embedded in the root of the nanomotor. It is a tiny, pulsating, metallic, heart-shaped chip. It has been a long time since he has felt this kind of excitement. He knows he has found the key to all his family’s scientific breakthroughs!
[NARRATION] He is overjoyed, and he believes he has found the key to controlling the nanobots. He knows he has found the key to saving the city. He knows he is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough, and he is determined to find the nanobots. His obsession will pay off soon.
[NARRATION] He has finally found the nanobots! He knows what he must do.
[NARRATION] He takes a glass of his homemade elixir, and pours it on the nano-chip, and presses his thumb against it, and everything stops.
[NARRATION] He is stunned. He does not believe this is possible. He knows he has found the key to all his family’s scientific breakthroughs! He knows he has found the key to controlling the nanobots! He knows he is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough!
[NARRATION] He has finally found the nanobots! He knows he has finally found the key!
[NARRATION] He knows he must get back into his laboratory. He cannot wait any longer.
[NARRATION] He picks up his tools and rushes back to his shop. He must put everything in order.
[NARRATION] He has finally found the nanobots! He knows he must hurry!
[NARRATION] He knows he must control them before they are out of control! He knows he must stop them before the news of his discovery is leaked! He knows his life is in danger. He knows he must get back into his lab!
