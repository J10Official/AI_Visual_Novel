You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

The old craftsman, his face a mask of wrinkles, was hunched over a workbench, tinkering with a prosthetic limb. His shop was cramped, smelling of sawdust and grease. He was known as the “Shoemaker” in the city’s underworld. He was a reclusive man, shunned by society for his unconventional methods. His shop was a refuge for the outcast, the disabled, and the forgotten. His work was illegal.

He was a craftsman of the old world, a man of the forge, a man of the past. His skills were legendary, but his life was a secret. He worked in the shadows, building custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts. He was a master of the forgotten arts, a man of the past. He was a man of the night.

He was alone. His wife had died years ago. His son, a cybernetically enhanced soldier, had left him. His only solace was his work. He worked late into the night, his workshop a sanctuary of shadows and metal. He was a man of solitude. He was a man of the night.

He had been working on a new prosthetic limb for a young boy with a missing leg. He had taken the boy’s leg off and put it on a table. He was a man of solitude. He was a man of the night. He was a man of the shadows.
