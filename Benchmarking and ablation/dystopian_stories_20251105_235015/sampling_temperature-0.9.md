You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker's Workshop
model
It was past midnight in the grimy workshop. Old Heinrich was tired, his face deeply furrowed. He wasn’t supposed to work, but a strange urge compelled him to tinker with a broken limb he had been working on. It was the only thing his daughter, Anna, had been able to bring him. In ten years, had he gone mad or simply forgotten what true purpose his life served? model
He worked with feverish passion, his mind consumed by the mystery of the limb, hoping to understand the peculiar energy in the nanobots. It was like a kind of life, breathing... but cold and metal. A strange, almost ethereal, beauty about it.
