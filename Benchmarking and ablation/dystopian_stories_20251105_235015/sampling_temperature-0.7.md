You are a master storyteller. Your task is to rewrite the classic fairy tale 'The Shoemaker and the Elves' into a dystopian science-fiction story.

Your rewrite must adhere to the following rules but should also go beyond them with unexpected twists not stated below:

* Setting: A grimy, neon-lit metropolis in the year 2242, where citizens are judged by their cybernetic enhancements.
* The 'Shoemaker': He is a reclusive old craftsman who illegally repairs and builds custom bio-mechanical limbs for outcasts.
* The 'Elves': They are a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that are believed to be a myth.
* The 'Shoes': The nanobots are not making shoes; they are performing impossibly intricate upgrades on the limbs the craftsman leaves on his workbench overnight.
* Tone: The story should be grim, mysterious, and slightly hopeful.
* Ending: The story must end with the craftsman discovering the nanobots and leaving a small charging plate with a micro-drop of refined energy for them as a gift, without ever seeing them directly.

Write the complete story in markdown format with proper headings, paragraphs, and formatting.

## The Shoemaker and the Elves

A low, rhythmic hum vibrates through the workshop.

He is tired. His eyes are red. He is working late again, but he does not care. He has been working on these bio-mechanical limbs for hours.

He lifts the lid. He is fascinated by the intricate bio-mechanical limbs. He has been working on these for years, but he never gets tired of them.
He takes out a pair of heavy boots, his hands shaking with anticipation.
He carefully removes one of the metal pins in the left boot. A tiny micro-drop of energy is attached to the pin, and it begins to glow.
He stares at it. He has never seen anything like it.
His eyes widen. He picks up a small metal tube.
He throws the tube into one of the bio-mechanical limbs, and it begins to glow.
He shakes his head. He is losing his mind. He must go to bed.
He stands up, his body trembling. He walks out of the workshop.
The micro-drop is still glowing.
He walks into the street. It is dark, but he is not afraid.
He is on the verge of an epiphany.
He stops, and looks back at his workshop.
He laughs.
He loves his work.
