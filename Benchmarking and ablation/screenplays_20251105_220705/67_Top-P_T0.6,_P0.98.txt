SCENE: Mystical Pond
MOOD: Mysterious
CHARACTERS: Woodcutter, Pond Spirit
SETTING: Daytime, pond with a small island

[NARRATION] The woodcutter walks down to the pond and stops at the small island. He looks at it for a moment, then, without a word, starts to dig. He digs with a small shovel, and soon gets deep enough to see into the muddy bottom of the pond.
[NARRATION] A moment later, he sees something in the mud, and starts to dig again.
[NARRATION] The mud is thick and muddy, and the shovel scrapes against it. The woodcutter continues digging, and soon he sees the outline of a large, wooden chest.
[NARRATION] He digs around the chest and soon, the whole thing is out of the mud. The chest is worn and weathered, but it is in good shape.
