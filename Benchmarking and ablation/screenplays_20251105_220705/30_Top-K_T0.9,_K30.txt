SCENE: Mystical Pond
MOOD: Mysterious
CHARACTERS: Woodcutter, Pond Spirit
SETTING: Morning, water lilies on the shore, fog rolling in

[NARRATION] The water lilies are in full bloom. Fog is rolling in.
Woodcutter (Surprised): I ... I didn’t...
[NARRATION] The boy stops, breathless.
[NARRATION] THE WOODCUTTER turns, but something prevents him from looking.
[NARRATION] THE POND SPIRIT floats toward THE WOODCUTTER, a long-limbed woman with the face of a bird. She seems almost weightless, and her head is as beautiful as the best lilies in the pond.
[NARRATION] She floats over to the boy and smiles gently. Then she turns to THE WOODCUTTER, not smiling.
Pond Spirit (Ostracized): Is a woman. Is a woman separated from her kind. Is a bird.
Woodcutter (Confused): Woman?
Pond Spirit (Disbelieving): Woman! What else could she be?
Woodcutter: What do you mean?
Pond Spirit (Demanding): What do you mean? Woman!
Pond Spirit (Re-affirmed): She’s a woman of the earth, a woman of the air, she’s a woman of water. Is water.
Pond Spirit (Relieved): And she is freed. Finally, freed.
Pond Spirit (Hopeful): She is free to be with you.

Pond Spirit (Inquisitive): Are you with her? Is she with you?
Woodcutter (Hesitant): Me? God, no. Me?
Pond Spirit (Angry): He is with her!
Sandpiper (Accusing): No! He’s with us. He’s one of us. He’s a light bearer. He’s a keeper of the fire. He carries the coal. He’s the keeper.
Woodcutter (Scared): I-I am no keeper of any fire. I never was. Just a man with a knife.
[NARRATION] He tries to run. He does not run far.
Pond Spirit (Stern): No! He is a keeper!
