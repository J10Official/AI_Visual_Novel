SCENE: Mystical Pond
MOOD: Mysterious
CHARACTERS: Woodcutter, Pond Spirit
SETTING: The pond in the woods, surrounded by willow trees

[NARRATION] We see the pond, the willow trees, the man and the child.
[NARRATION] As the man walks by the pond, we see for the first time the thing in the water. A bird, or a turtle, or some other strange animal, but not one that can be easily identified.
[NARRATION] The man walks closer to the pond and looks down at the strange creature. It is gone.
[NARRATION] The man bends down to the edge of the water, and stares for a moment. Then:
[NARRATION] Suddenly, a face appears out of the water! It is that of the pond spirit!
[NARRATION] The man is momentarily startled. Then he smiles.
[NARRATION] The spirit waves, holding a branch, which is floating in the water. It looks almost like a cane.
[NARRATION] The man smiles again, this time a little bit more warmly. He waves back, then slowly starts to walk away.
