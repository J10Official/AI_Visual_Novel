SCENE: Mystical Pond
MOOD: Mysterious
CHARACTERS: Woodcutter, Pond Spirit
SETTING: Daytime, pond with clear water, logs on the shore

[NARRATION] The man goes to the edge of the pond. The water is clear, and there are logs lying on the shore.
Woodcutter (Resigned): It’s the only way.
[NARRATION] He starts to put the logs on a wheeled cart, and drags them to the shore of the pond. The logs seem to float a little, and the water seems to move to the logs, as if the pond were trying to swallow them up.
