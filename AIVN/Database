  DESCRIPTION: "The omniscient voice that guides the story, providing atmospheric descriptions and context for the unfolding events in Aethelburg."
- ID: kaelen
  DESCRIPTION: "A sharp, cynical investigator for the Aegis Bureau. Seen too much of Aethelburg's underbelly to be surprised by anything, but still holds onto a sliver of curiosity."
- ID: anya
  DESCRIPTION: "Kaelen's Bureau handler. Efficient, professional, and strictly by-the-book. Views the world through data points and mission parameters."

- ID: the_glitch
  DESCRIPTION: "A dimly lit dive bar in the city's underbelly, reeking of spilled synth-ale and ozone. A known neutral ground for illicit information exchanges."
- ID: lower_decks

- ID: abandoned_lab
